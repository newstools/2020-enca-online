It’s been a day of protest and outrage at click’s stores countrywide, a response to a Tresemme advert on Clicks website last week that used the words dry and damaged under photographs of black women’s hair and showed a picture of a white woman’s hair with the tag normal. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Former public protector, Professor Thuli Madonsela, says the Clicks Black Hair advert matter is a textbook case of unconscious bias. She says calling it out is great but anarchy and violence undermine the cause. Madonsela says it is imperative for people to examine their own perceptions about life. "We call it unconscious bias when a person shoots themselves in the foot because you and me Sally, should agree that Clicks is a trading company, it was not its intention to offend black people or black women. Its intention was the opposite, to attract them to Clicks to buy. The reason it has offended us is because unconsciously it has assumed that what is abnormal is normal," said Madonsela.

In response to the advert, the EFF staged nationwide protests against Clicks.
