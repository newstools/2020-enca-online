Knysna has launched a tourist jewel in collaboration with the SA National Parks and SA Forest Adventures. Tanya Nefdt puts it to the test. Courtesy #DStv403  KNYSNA - The Southern Cape region has launched its biggest tourism product in nearly a decade -- a zipline that's one of the longest in the country. It's a collaboration between SA National Parks and SA Forest Adventures and it's hoped that the new attraction will draw local and international visitors back to the Garden Route. The Kranshoek zipline is close to 2 and a half kilometres of sheer adrenaline. Visitors are able to zip on four separate lines, giving them a full overview of the magnificent Garden Route National Park which includes the vast indigenous forest, the ocean and South Africa’s renowned fynbos.
