The show, scheduled to take place in the southern coastal city of Zhuhai from 10 November, was set to feature major companies such as Boeing. But China remains closed off to most international travellers due to tight restrictions to stop a resurgence of the coronavirus, which first surfaced in the central city of Wuhan before spreading across the globe.

It has been a platform for Beijing to show off military equipment and technology such as stealth drones, as well as to unveil a replica of China's first permanently crewed space station. While Asia's biggest air show in Singapore went ahead in February -- with measures in place to guard against the deadly pathogen -- over 70 exhibitors including industry giant Lockheed Martin chose to skip the show.
