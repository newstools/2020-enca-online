Serena Williams returns a shot to Sloane Stephens at the 2020 US Open. NEW YORK - Serena Williams progressed to the US Open last 16 as the tournament endured fresh controversy after New York health officials ordered the women's top doubles pairing be withdrawn over coronavirus fears. Williams, chasing a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title, came from a set down to oust 2017 champion Sloane Stephens 2-6, 6-2, 6-2, in what she called an "intense" encounter on Arthur Ashe Stadium. "In that first set I don't think she made any errors, honestly. She was just playing so clean and I just said, 'I don't want to lose in straight sets,'" said Williams.

It's interesting, I like it," said Williams, who will play 15th seed Maria Sakkari for a place in the quarter-finals. Off the court, number one seeds Kristina Mladenovic and Timea Babos were yanked from the women's doubles competition after Mladenovic was instructed to quarantine for coming in contact with Benoit Paire, who tested positive for COVID-19 last weekend. "All persons who were identified as having prolonged close contact with the infected player will quarantine in their rooms for the remainder of their quarantine period," the United States Tennis Association said in a statement.
