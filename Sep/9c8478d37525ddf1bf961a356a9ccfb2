It's been more than a week since a group of protesters from Mpumalanga set up camp at the Union Buildings. Today they are targeting the office of the Finance Minister, demanding that money for the upgrades be made available. eNCA's Nqobile Madlala is covering that story.

They want to know why the dangerous Moloto Road hasn't been upgraded, despite funds being allocated for this. They also say they were promised a railway as far back as 1994. The group wants answers from Treasury. READ: No relief for Moloto Road users The project was touched on during the budget vote speech delivered by the then minister of transport, Dipuo Peters in 2015. Peters outlined a number of roads and transport projects for the year ahead. She indicated that a process of proclaiming the road as a national road was at "the advanced stage" with the provincial governments of Limpopo and Mpumalanga transferring part of the road to the national Department. The following year, South Africa signed a co-operation agreement with the People’s Republic of China to build the Moloto Rail Development Corridor.

The Moloto Road stretches over 160km and spans three provinces -- Gauteng, Mpumalanga and Limpopo. It is used by over 60,000 commuters daily. The protesters are asking for the promise to be finally fulfilled.
