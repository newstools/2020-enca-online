Oscar Morales went to get his first tattoo after seeing the offer by the artist in the northern city of Monterrey on social media. The 20-year-old tested positive for the virus and was asymptomatic, but worries that he was the one who infected his father, sister, and grandfather, who was hospitalized. "I work a lot in the street. Maybe I infected them. Unfortunately, many people don't survive. Thank God, and all my family and I are fine," he said. Mexico has registered more than 64,000 deaths from the coronavirus -- one of the world's highest tolls. Morales admits that he underestimated the risks at first and did not take precautions even though his work involved going from one factory to another in the industrial hub. "Since I tested positive I'm really careful, always wearing a mask and disinfecting my hands," he said.
