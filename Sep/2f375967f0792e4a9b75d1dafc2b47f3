Neymar's accusation that Gonzalez racially abused him will be investigated on September 30, the commission announced. Neymar was sent off for slapping Gonzalez on the back of the head, accusing the Spaniard of calling him a "monkey". Gonzalez denies the charge. The world's most expensive player was served with a two-match ban last week for that incident in the September 13 fixture at the Parc des Princes. Also last week PSG defender Layvin Kurzawa incurred a six-match ban for kicking out at Marseille left-back Jordan Amavi, who was hit with a suspension of three games after he too was dismissed.
