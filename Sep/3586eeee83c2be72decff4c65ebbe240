Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - White and Indian South Africans are more likely to be appointed and given promotions, according to a new Commission for Employment Equality report. Among some of the other findings is that only 15,2 percent of the top managers in the country are black.

Kabinde said, "on average, we are having a 1 percentage point movement from the white population to the designated groups per annum. "This is very, very slow if you consider that around 31.1 percent of the Black population -- that means African, Coloured and Indian -- is represented at top management. It means it's going to take us another 60 years if we follow this trajectory." She said that the government has monitored how employers have complied with employment equity.

The bill will ensure non-compliant businesses will soon be barred from doing business with the state. The introduction of further punishments could follow.
