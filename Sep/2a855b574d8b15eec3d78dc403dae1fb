The Growthpoint SA Nationals will take place at the Brooklyn Mall in Pretoria from October 15 to 17. Squash SA Acting President Jennifer Sawyer says that the sport -- like any other -- had some re-assessment to do. "What we decided to do was to sit down and re-assess what could do for the players, the provinces and the clubs. And normally the Growthpoint SA Nationals are hosted at one hub. And now we opened all eight hubs to encourage their squash players to play without any travel," Sawyer said.

Sawyer believes this will allow them to safeguard players' health. "This has increased our numbers considerably on entries and also to look after players' health issues," Sawyer said. There are over 315 entries, which is the highest the tournament has had.
