KOPER, Slovenia - A burnt wooden statue of Slovenian-born US First Lady Melania Trump, described by the artist as representing tensions in the United States, went on show at an art gallery in the Slovenian seaside town of Koper. The statue was torched by unknown perpetrators while on show in the open air near her birthplace Sevnica, on July 4, celebrated as Independence Day in the United States. "This object (the burnt statue) somehow represents a visual representation of political tensions that are erupting in my country and not only in my country," Berlin-based American artist Brad Downey told Reuters.

Also on show are a plastic replica of the wooden sculpture and moulds used to make a bronze statue of Trump that is due to be unveiled in Rozno near Sevnica next week, in the spot where the wooden statue used to stand.
