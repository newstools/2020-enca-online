Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Automobile Association says government must invest more in the public transport sector. The association's Layton Beard says the global trends show people are becoming less reliant on private vehicles. "What we have seen throughout the world is that public transport is becoming increasingly important and there needs to be more of an investment in reliable and affordable transport. "We are seeing fewer people with private vehicles because as I said earlier, there is a reduced need for that transport but there is a need for public transport," said Beard.
