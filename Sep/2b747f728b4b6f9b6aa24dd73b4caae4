File: Health Minister Zweli Mkhize. JOHANNESBURG - Health Minister Zweli Mkhize says the COVID-19 storm has passed. He believes government made the right decision, at the right time, to reopen the economy. He was responding to the EFF in Parliament who questioned why government is trading lives by doing so, and warning that more people will die from the virus. "What we wanted to save our people from is that they should not have the problem of food security, the problem of income security, unemployment and so on. It's the majority of the black people who lose the jobs because the economy is close, it's the majority who have the challenge who have access to income, so when we reopen the economy it's not about big business it's about the fact that the black people are the backbone of the economy, they work the economy, but they also depend on that economy, the government can give so much of packages," said Mkhize.
