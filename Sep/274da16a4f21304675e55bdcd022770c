Western Cape health authorities introduced a system during the coronavirus pandemic, to have non-COVID patients' medication delivered to their homes. Tens of thousands of chronic medication parcels are now being distributed to vulnerable patients by community health workers. The health workers sort the parcels containing the medication according to the addresses and then hit the road with the help of some neighbourhood watch members. At the same time, community health workers also screen for COVID-19 and do referrals if necessary. “We also screen for TB," said Anthea Abrahams, clinical programme coordinator. "Just because it is COVID does not mean we stop other services and to see if there are other health needs within the home.” Patients are grateful for this new arrangement. The aim is to keep this home delivery system going post-COVID-19.
