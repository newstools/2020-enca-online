Bollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty (C) arrives at the Enforcement Directorate (ED) office within the scope of the investigation of the suicide case of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, in Mumbai on August 7, 2020 MUMBAI - Bollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty has been arrested for allegedly buying drugs for her former boyfriend, the actor Sushant Singh Rajput, whose suicide sparked a media storm in India. Rajput was found dead in June in his Mumbai apartment, with police saying he took his own life. A star with many hit movies to his name, his suicide initially triggered a debate over mental health in the multi-billion-dollar industry. But Rajput's family disputed reports that he suffered from depression and accused Chakraborty of stealing his money and harassing him. She has strongly denied the allegations. Chakraborty was arrested on Tuesday. The police have also detained others in connection with the case including her brother and a member of Rajput's house staff. India's top anti-crime agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation, has been probing his death since last month. The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) was looking into the star's consumption of cannabis. "We will be opposing bail petitions" for all suspects, NCB Director Mutha Ashok Jain told reporters. The actress has been remanded to judicial custody until September 22. The investigation has grabbed headlines for months, with the media closely following the back-and-forth allegations between Rajput's family and Chakraborty.
