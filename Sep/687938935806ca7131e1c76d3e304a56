For the second time in just over a week, a Safeway grocery store in Lake Tahoe got an unexpected visitor: a bear. (Video courtesy of Rubī Nevarez.) LAKE TAHOE - A grocery store in California got an unexpected visitor recently. A bear wandered into the store in Kings Beach at Lake Tahoe and picked up some groceries. The furry customer was caught on video by another shopper. It could be seen rummaging around the fresh produce. Tahoe is bear country, and it’s the second time the same store had been visited by a bear in recent weeks. On 18 August, a bear was seen grabbing a bag of Tostitos and walking out. It’s not clear if the bears in both videos are the same.
