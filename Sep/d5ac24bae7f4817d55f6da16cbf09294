Mbalula said the taxi industry is marred by gruesome events and violence, but the ministry is confident it has great potential. Mbalula said he is not trying to reinvent the wheel but intends to continue the good work done by his predecessors.

Mbalula also said the discussions would address the factors leading to disunity and violence. He said programs like the Taxi Recapitalisation Programme would be evaluated and decisions would be taken to enable the industry to benefit.

He said participation of these officials in the sector weakens law enforcement who are motivated to protect their assets and associates. The minister said the conduct of taxi operators and compliance with traffic laws as well as the prevalance of gender-based violence in the industry are serious causes for concerns. Mbalula announced the National Land Transport Bill is before the president after being passed by Parliament which should strengthen regulations within the e-hailing taxi industry.
