JOHANNESBURG - The Passenger Rail Agency (Prasa) will soon announce a security plan to protect its rail infrastructure. But it appears to be too little too late. The network across the country has been pillaged by thieves and will cost hundreds of millions of rand to get operational again.

The only line still operational is the one to Mamelodi -- it is one of four in the whole country still working. Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has conceded that the system has been left vulnerable.

The station and the lines around Pretoria and the station were unguarded and sometimes home to people living rough. This is apparently about to change.
