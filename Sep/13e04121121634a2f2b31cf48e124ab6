Editor's Note: This Livestream will start at 7pm JOHANNESBURG - Join hosts Thembekile Mrototo and Athandiwe Saba as we celebrate the fourteenth Mail & Guardian 200 Young South Africans roll of honour. Every year since 2006, the publication featured 200 young South Africans, on course to touch the world with their greatness. It is not an award as much as it is a mark of distinction, a number of young people featured have since grown into leaders in their fields.
