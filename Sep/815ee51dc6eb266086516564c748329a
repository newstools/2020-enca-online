File: ActionSA's Herman Mashaba. JOHANNESBURG - The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has rejected the registration of Action SA as a political party. This is because of similarities with the Party of Action (POA), and the use of the South African flag in the logo. READ: POA: Mashaba stole our logo Former Johannesburg mayor, Herman Mashaba applied to the IEC for registration of his party earlier this month. In a statement, Action SA says the IEC has acted irrationally and it is appealing the decision.
