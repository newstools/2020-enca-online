CAPE TOWN - The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) says it's hot on the heels of another top-ranking official in the Western Cape suspected of PPE corruption. In July, the SIU pounced on officials from the Matzikama Local Municipality over their alleged involvement in irregular contracts. The unit now says a municipal manager at the Cederberg Municipality could be linked to this matter.

"We found three contractors there that were given contracts in an improper manner. And while we were investigating them it then led us to other municipalities," said SIU Communications Head, Kaizer Kganyago. Last week, the SIU says it was prevented by law enforcement from entering this building.

"He locked the offices because at that time we did not have the search and seizure order."
