What exactly happened at a Pick n Pay in Witbank earlier this week? There are allegations that two women found shoplifting were placed in a cold storage room overnight. Pick n Pay's Group Executive: Strategy and Corporate Affairs David North spoke to Jeremy Maggs. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Pick n Pay said allegations that two women were locked overnight in a cold storage room are false. This comes after reports the duo was caught shoplifting and one of them has allegedly died since the incident.

Its head of strategy and corporate affairs, David North, explained the events of that day to eNCA  earlier. "Tuesday 1 September, our security personnel in the store, saw two people acting suspiciously, suspected of shoplifting. They were followed, carefully and respectfully. When they left the store without paying, they were asked by our security staff to stay at the store. Police were notified and they were asked to stay until the police arrived." North said the two individuals waited in a meeting room, upstairs in the store, nowhere close to cold storage. He said there is video footage of the two people leaving the store in a healthy condition and said neither made any complaints about their treatment once leaving. North said Pick n Pay has released the video footage of the incident to SAPS and indicated willingness to make the footage public should it be permitted to do so.
