Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula will be launching the Passenger Rail Agency's ministerial security plan on Wednesday. It aims to eliminate vandalism and theft. Mbalula says his department will work with other government clusters to ensure the plan's success. More than three thousand Prasa security personnel have been in-sourced as part of the plan.
