"We do not want to see the old incidences where tourists are attacked and where tourists are not safe in our country,” Kubayi-Ngubane said. Tsitsikamma boasts the world’s highest commercial bungee-jump, as well as the only canopy tours in an indigenous forest in Africa. "National parks are the melting pot of natural heritage of our country," "We have everything if you are interested in adventure if you are interested in Safari if you are interested in cultural heritage we have it all in national parks." Reynold Thakhuli, SanParks spokesperson.
