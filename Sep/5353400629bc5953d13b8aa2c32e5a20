Police minister Bheki Cele says an investigation must determine why protection was withdrawn from the top cop. Kinnear was gunned down in his vehicle in front of his house on Friday afternoon. It follows previous threats on his life at his Bishop Lavis home.

His eldest son was the last to speak to him, mere minutes before he was assassinated by, an as yet unknown assailant, believed to have been lying in wait for him. Carlisle Kinnear came out of the house to find his father slumped behind the wheel, shot multiple times. "I’m not angry at the police but there are questions, why were the guards removed? It’s too late now, my dad ran his race I salute him, I’m proud of him," he said.

The fact that my husband is no longer with us, I think they might have to want to get to us to get to him but, of course, he doesn’t share his investigations with their families,” she said. Police Minister Bheki Cele concedes Kinnear’s death is a blight on the service. Cele is promising answers as to who might be behind Kinnear’s death within 72 hours.
