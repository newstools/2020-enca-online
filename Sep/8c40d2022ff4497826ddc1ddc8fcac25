Payments were put on hold two weeks ago when the Auditor-General flagged lax controls over who qualifies for the relief. The UIF says it's now fixed the problems and is ready to go.

The UIF says it regrets the inconvenience caused. "We are aware that many workers around the country have been placed on a back foot as a result of the need to ensure that our systems stand up to scrutiny and we close the gaps identified by the Auditor General. While the inconvenience was greatly regretted, we are pleased that we have turned things around in what we believe is quick time and our systems are ready to make a difference in the lives of the workers again," said Marsha Bronkhorst, Acting UIF Commissioner.
