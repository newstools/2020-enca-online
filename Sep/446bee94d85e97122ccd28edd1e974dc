File: South African Airways. JOHANNESBURG - South African Airways Business Rescue Practitioners have decided to suspend all of the airline's repatriation flights with immediate effect.
This is a measure to put the national carrier under care and maintenance until funding discussions are completed. The BRPs say they, together with government, have engaged certain funders that have indicated their willingness to provide a portion of the funding to implement the business rescue plan. Two weeks ago, the BRPs indicated that they need time to assess and determine the appropriate way to proceed in the absence of funding.
