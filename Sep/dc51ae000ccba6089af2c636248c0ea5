File: The album is Bruce Springsteen's first time back with the E Street Band since his 2016 tour "The River." NEW YORK - Bruce Springsteen announced he will release a new album on 23 October, giving fans a sneak peek by dropping its title track "Letter To You." With its layered guitars and dramatic percussion, the song is classic E Street Band - the group Springsteen has performed with since 1972 - which returned to back The Boss's 20th studio album after he released his 2019 record "Western Stars" solo. "I love the emotional nature of 'Letter To You,'" the 70-year-old performer said in a statement. "And I love the sound of the E Street Band playing completely live in the studio, in a way we've never done before, and with no overdubs," he continued, saying they made the album in just five days, recording at his home studio in New Jersey. "It turned out to be one of the greatest recording experiences I've ever had." "Letter to You" features nine songs Springsteen penned recently, along with new versions of three previously unreleased tracks from the 1970s: "Janey Needs a Shooter," "If I Was the Priest" and "Song for Orphans." The album is Springsteen's first time back with the E Street Band since his 2016 tour "The River."
