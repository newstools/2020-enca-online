Courtesy of #DStv403 DURBAN - Embattled former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede could face more problems. Gumede and her supporters allegedly contravened an ANC resolution during her court appearance at the Durban Commercial Crimes Court last week. READ: Gumede returns to court The party's provincial committee is accusing Gumede of failing to condemn her supporters outside the court. ANC KZN secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli said they went to court without a mandate from the ANC. READ: Gumede's corruption trial postponed "When they arrive in court, they are carrying placards and doing things that are undermining the standing of the African National Congress," Ntuli said. "We condemn that in the strongest terms and it's a matter we're going to discuss with Comrade Zandile. "Some of these people who are doing wrong things were disowned by Comrade Zandile, she said to us, "these are not my supporters", but what happened in court is she went out and addressed those people," said Ntuli. READ: I am a servant of the people, Gumede says "When she addressed those people, she did not say to them " I appreciate your support during the difficulties I am confronted with but I condemn your conduct that sows divisions in the African National Congress" and we will have to engage her on that as the leadership of the ANC. "We can't allow that there are people who have a license to undermine the authority of the organisation and go even further to act in a way that seeks to implant divisions in the African National Congress."
