Five baby gorillas have been born in just six weeks in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda. KAMPALA - Uganda says it has recorded a baby boom among gorillas in a national park that is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the East African country's most prized tourist attractions. Five babies have been born in just six weeks in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, according to the state-run Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA). The park is located near Uganda's southwestern border with Democratic Republic of Congo. The latest, born last weekend, brings the total born this year to seven. In comparison only three were born last year.
