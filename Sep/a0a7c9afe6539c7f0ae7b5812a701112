Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Famous British Primatologist, Jane Goodall, is shocked at what she describes as aggressive methods of managing baboons in Cape Town. The relocation of a young male baboon to Tokai has sparked outrage from animal activists, demanding his return home to Kommetjie. According to the City of Cape Town, the baboon, named Kataza, was relocated because of his problematic behaviour. He’s been accused of raiding and dispersing his tribe but community members say he’s innocent. Kataza has spent a few nights this week on the roof of Pollsmoor prison.

The City of Cape Town believes he will soon join a local troop but community members from his home town of Kommetjie don’t believe he stands a chance here. The city says the decision to move him was made after engagements with experts. The drama started after Kataza disappeared following an application to have him euthanised was rejected. For the past 21 years, scientists say the baboon population has grown by 58-percent.
