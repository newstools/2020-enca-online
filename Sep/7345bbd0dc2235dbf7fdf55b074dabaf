JOHANNESBURG - Eskom has suspended managers of the Kendal and Tutuka power stations pending disciplinary processes. This is following the implementation of stage four load-shedding this week. Eskom says the manager’s failures are partly to blame for the recent power outages and stresses that weak management will no longer be tolerated. Further interventions are ongoing at the Kriel and Duvha power stations. According to a statement, there’s been serious issues of unconcerned behaviour by some in management. "Engagements have been held with other power station managers to ensure that the previous culture of weak consequence management will no longer be the norm and will no longer be tolerated at Eskom," the power utility said in a statement. "The Executive has, in the meantime, deployed three senior Generation managers to the sites in question (Duvha, Kriel, Tutuka and Kendal power stations) to provide leadership and oversight in person."
