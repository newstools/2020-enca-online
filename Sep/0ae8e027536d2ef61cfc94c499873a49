A view from the TRESemmé Salon. JOHANNESBURG - TRESemmé South Africa has apologised for the advertising campaign that has outraged South Africans. This follows a backlash over the advert which compared black hair unfavourably to white hair. TRESemmé says it is sorry that images used in its South Africa marketing campaign on the Clicks website promoted racist stereotypes. It says the campaign set out to celebrate the beauty of all hair types and the range of solutions that TRESemmé offers, but they got it wrong.

We are looking into how this happened and why it wasn’t picked up, and we will take all necessary steps to make sure it doesn’t happen again," TRESemmé South Africa said. Clicks has since removed TRESemmé products from its shelves.
