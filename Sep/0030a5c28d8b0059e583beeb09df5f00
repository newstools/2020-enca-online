"How can this person rape or attempt to rape? A small child added to that? I took as though he is attacking my own child. Because this child is young enough to call me her father."
Maeteletja was helped by other teens to apprehend the perpetrator, who had managed to run and hide inside a classroom at a nearby school. READ: Grandmother, granddaughter raped in Soweto The teenager was attacked by community members before being rescued by police.
The little girl's aunt says her niece is traumatised and says she will never play outside again. "He carried my niece and covered her mouth. She says she tried to fight him but he was too strong. Then he took her down the Jukskei River. His pants were already off when they found him, but luckily he didn't rape her".
