The App-driven Women Go service hires only female drivers and operates around the mother city. Founder, Asiphe Mkhefa says she wanted to offer a more secure option to female passengers in response to gender-based violence.

While some have welcomed the initiative, the teen and her family have been forced to seek refuge elsewhere due to threats by taxi bosses. The 18-year-old says she plans to expand her services to other provinces to but for now, she is focusing on her matric studies.
