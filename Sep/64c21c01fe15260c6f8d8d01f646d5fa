"Right now, our focus is on the worst economic crisis in 100 years. We're in a deep economic recession. "We have 40 percent of workers unemployed and millions more might lose their jobs. We're very worried about simply cutting expenditure. We have to stimulate the economy, we have to find resources," Parks said.
