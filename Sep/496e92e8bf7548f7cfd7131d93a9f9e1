Following the release of a statement on Tuesday, ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe said in response to a question about whether the party admits state resources were abused: "The ANC would not necessarily use the words that you are using, words like "messed up", words like "abused resources", those are not necessarily part of the lexicon of the African National Congress. The movement comes out to humble itself before the people of South Africa, take responsibility and then commit to action, that's what the organisation does at all times." When asked again on whether the party had improperly used state resources, Mabe said: "We don't even want to go into the merits and demerits. It is well known the work that the African National Congress was doing in Zimbabwe. It is actually in the interests not just of the ANC itself in this country, it is in the interests of the people of South Africa, as a whole." Mabe restated that the mission of the ANC delegation was to serve national interests.
