He says the neighbouring country is in crisis. "40 years after independence in Zimbabwe the only thing that's changed is the name of the country and leaders, in plain English, there's a crisis in Zimbabwe, not just challenges and that's why ZANU-PF officials used the word crisis more than 40 times and Zimbabwean lives matter," he said.
