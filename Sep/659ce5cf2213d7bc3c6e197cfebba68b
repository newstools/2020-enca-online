The 60-year-old blames the Dora Nginza Hospital for negligence after she was incorrectly diagnosed with tubercular meningitis. Zukiwe Mangwane says after doctors performed a lumbar puncture there was a numbness in her legs and the procedure contributed to her ailing health. Mangwane still bears the emotional scars of that horrific day on 9 December.

Mangwane claims the hospital tried to cover things up by pretending that they were never responsible for the operation. Sabelo Williams, a community leader of Kwazakele township, says Mangwane has exhausted all avenues to get justice.

According to this patient there were no investigations conducted whatsoever and that the hospital actually denied that she spent time there. Mangwane has also suffered two strokes and fears that she may not live long enough to get justice.
