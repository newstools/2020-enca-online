They have been living in a Baptist church for more than seven months. While the land allocated to them doesn't yet have water, electricity or sanitation, residents say they're grateful to rebuild. WATCH: Relocation of Mamelodi flood victims delayed Some of the flood victims who lost everything and can't rebuilt their shacks remain at the church. They'll be given temporary houses to start their new lives. The City of Tshwane says this process of giving serviced land will continue as per the commitment by the Gauteng government and it hopes that those who need land will wait for this process to unfold instead of resorting to land invasions.
