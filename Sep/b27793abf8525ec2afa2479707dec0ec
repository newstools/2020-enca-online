"I am going to make a request to Safa and PSL to allow 50 supporters, or 100 supporters, from each team – we’ve got 16 teams. So now if they say we can, so we have to work hand-in-hand with the Chairperson of the branches to select the best supporters…” This, Maake hopes, can be used as a template for spectators for next season.
