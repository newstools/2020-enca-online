The mastermind behind the kidnapping of a 6-year-old Vanderbijlpark girl and her co-accused appeared in the Palm Ridge Court. JOHANNESBURG - Relief and a chance to start over. This is how the family of a Vanderbijlpark girl feels after her kidnappers were sentenced on Thursday. Former teacher Katharina Human and her co-accused got between five and 10 years for kidnapping and were also convicted for attempted extortion. They had all pleaded guilty to abducting the then 6-year-old outside a school in September last year.
