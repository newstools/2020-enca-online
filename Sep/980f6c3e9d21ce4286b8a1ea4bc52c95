The council's secretary-general Gregory Nthatise says it welcomes Ramaphosa's dismissal of the letter,
but is disappointed no action has been taken. The MK veterans national council held a briefing on the current situation in the ANC. READ: Jacob Zuma pens letter challenging Ramaphosa The council says there are two ANCs -- one of which is fighting corruption while the other is defending it. “The ANC is no longer at a crossroads, however, on a downward spiral," said Gregory Nthatisi. "Most disturbingly, it is taking our country down alongside itself on this unfortunate destructive path.” READ: Zuma's letter expected to be on the agenda at ANC NEC meeting The council says the existence of two ANCs within one party is accelerating this decline -- and one must leave. “These comrades are emboldened to do wrong things, feeling they’ve got support within ANC," said Ike Moroe of the council. "It is time that they must prepare themselves to step aside, perhaps find themselves another ANC, outside this ANC that we wish to be ethical.” WATCH: ANC veterans speak on party issues The council is bemoaning the preservation of unity at the expense of the ANC’s values. “We cannot pursue unity forever, with the people who do not want to see the ANC united,” Moroe said.
