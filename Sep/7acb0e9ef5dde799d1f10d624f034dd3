Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - An R82-million school in Tembisa is standing empty while pupils are taught in containers. The Infrastructure Development Department has not been able to get a certificate of occupancy as the school was built in a waterlogged area. It has stood vacant for almost three years. READ: Tembisa land 'invaders' have nowhere else to go One South Africa Movement's Mmusi Maimane said the government must account for the injustice. Maimane said the infrastructure design plan was flawed from the beginning, allowing for the current situation where untreated sewage flows on the campus and an unsafe learning environment. Mpho Modise, chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Infrastructure Development, said the government is motivating for a criminal case to be opened against the officials in the Department and the contractor involved in the project.
