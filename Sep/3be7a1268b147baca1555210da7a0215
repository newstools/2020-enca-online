JOHANNESBURG - He needed help but instead a 22-year-old Tembisa man who was having a mental breakdown was shot dead by police. The incident happened on Monday after Tshepiso Adoons' family called the SAPS to help restrain him and take him to a psychiatric facility. But he was killed while more than 10 officers stood outside his shack.

When his grandmother called the police, she expected them to take him to the hospital so the family could find out why his behaviour had changed. Instead, this call for help resulted in him being shot dead. READ: Ipid probes fatal shooting of Alexandra mom And now, police officers are allegedly covering it up to protect their boss. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) says once it has enough evidence, it will advise the police on whether to suspend the officer from duty. “The investigation continues," said Ipid spokesperson Ndileka Cola. "So once there is a threshold of evidence that has been gathered, that informs what the Ipid does.” The EFF says it will campaign for the accused officer to be suspended until the case is heard in court.
