Grobler and his wife were in tears, as their property was removed from the house. The couple has been working the land, just 35 kilometres south-east of Harare, for over 22 years.

I would have liked a few days to pack properly, but they are just carrying everything out, nothing is packed. They are taking everything out and putting it outside the gate. We have no plan. We don't know where we are going."
