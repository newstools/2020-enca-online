JOHANNESBURG - The South African National Editors’ Forum (Sanef) is calling on the Gender Commission and Parliament to investigate the harassment and intimidation of eNCA journalist Nobesuthu Hejana. Hejana was confronted by EFF members and told to move while reporting on protests against Clicks in Cape Town. READ: EFF slams harassment of eNCA crew Sanef also says it's concerned at  EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi's statements he made on social media. Ndlozi tweeted that touching Hejana was not considered harassment and that 'the touch has to be violent, invasive or harmful to be considered harassment. The forum says the incident is horrifying given the country's current battle with GBV and is calling on Ndlozi to apologise.
