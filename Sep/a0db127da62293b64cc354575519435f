People gather around one of the pools at the 9/11 Memorial as it reopens on Independence Day after months-long closure due to the coronavirus pandemic. The 9/11 Museum, which closed at the same time as the Memorial, in March, remains closed to the public. NEW YORK - New York on Friday will mark the 19th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic and a bitter fight with the White House. The city will hold its annual ceremony in memory of the nearly 3,000 people who died in the bloodiest terrorist attack in US history, punctuated by a minute's silence at the exact moments that Al-Qaeda jihadists crashed two hijacked airplanes into the World Trade Center towers.

But they will still be present at the "Ground Zero" memorial. The site museum will also open for the first time since the novel coronavirus brought the city to a standstill in March. Almost two decades after the attacks, September 11 remains synonymous with New York's heroism and resilience.
