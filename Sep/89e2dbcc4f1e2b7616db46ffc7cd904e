JOHANNESBURG - South Africa has reported fewer than 1,000 new coronavirus infections, the lowest daily increase in three months, as health authorities warn that a second wave remains a risk. The country is the hardest-hit in Africa, registering around half of the continent's more than 1.3 million coronavirus cases. But the number of new infections has been declining steadily since an average daily peak of around 12,000 in July.
