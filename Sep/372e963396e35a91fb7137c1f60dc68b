Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - There will be more meetings this weekend between Cricket South Africa and Sascoc. These meetings follow the issuing of a five-point resolution plan by Sascoc, to address the rot at CSA. The organisations do not see eye-to-eye on the matter. READ: Cricket SA appoints new acting CEO News that a troubled Sascoc has asked the embattled CSA board and its senior executives to step aside, temporarily, has plunged the cricket organisation to new lows. It’s a resolution CSA has rejected while it seeks legal advice on ways to resolve the deadlock. But Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa has welcomed the Sascoc intervention.

READ: Mthethwa concerned by Sascoc Sascoc insists it is within its rights as the governing body of sport in the country. “This is not administration, but it’s a process that is provided for in the Sascoc constitution, and it’s within the mandates of the macro body to provide this intervention," said Sascoc's acting CEO Ravi Govender.
