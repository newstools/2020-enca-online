Serena Williams crashed out of the US Open semi-finals, blowing a set lead to lose in three hard-fought sets to former world number Victoria Azarenka. NEW YORK - Serena Williams plans to dust herself down after the disappointment of another failed attempt at a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam singles title and continue her chase at Roland Garros this month. Williams crashed out of the US Open semi-finals on Thursday, blowing a set lead to lose in three hard-fought sets to former world number Victoria Azarenka. "It's obviously disappointing but at the same time I did what I could today," a weary-looking Williams told reporters.

It has been more than three years since Williams won her 23rd singles tennis major title at the 2017 Australian Open -- when she was already pregnant with daughter Olympia. The 38-year-old has come close since, reaching four major finals only to come away empty-handed, and needs one more to match Margaret Court's record of 24.

Williams, who has a history of serious lung problems, said she wanted to talk to organizers about safety protocols after they said that some spectators would be in attendance. After the French Open tournament director announced that all players will be housed in two designated hotels "without exception," Williams added that she had hoped she would be able to stay in her Paris apartment. When asked Thursday night whether she would compete for a third title at Roland Garros, she answered: "Yeah, I mean, I'm definitely going to be going to Paris."
