JOHANNESBURG - Tens of thousands of people are being deprived of humanitarian aid in northern Mozambique as extremist militants intensify an Islamist insurgency, the UN agency World Food Programme said on Monday. Jihadists have been waging a violent campaign in the gas-rich Cabo Delgado province since 2017, launching sporadic attacks on towns and villages in a bid to establish a caliphate.

Lola Castro, World Food Programme's regional director for southern Africa, said that of those 250,000 internally displaced, "we are accessing 180,000" -- leaving 70,000 people without aid. Speaking to journalists in Johannesburg, Castro described northern Mozambique as "a very worrisome area". Cabo Delgado's insurgency has increasingly hampered humanitarian assistance in the area in recent months, forcing the International Committee for the Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders to suspend operations in the town of Macomia in June.

Castro also warned that food insecurity could affect 44.8 million people across the southern African region -- up from 41.2 million last year -- in the coming months through to 2021.

Thirteen of the 16 countries in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) bloc are threatened with food insecurity "not seen in many years," Castro added.
