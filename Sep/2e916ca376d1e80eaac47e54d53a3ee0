"Abusing women is not our tradition, nor is it our custom. It is not, and will never be, our heritage," Ramaphosa said. "Throughout the history of this continent, women have built and shaped our societies. They have ruled kingdoms. They have been highly respected and valued. "We must put an end to this terrible shame that is tainting the image of our country. When you oppress a woman, you oppress a nation. When you beat a woman, you beat a nation. We must do away with practices that discriminate against women."
