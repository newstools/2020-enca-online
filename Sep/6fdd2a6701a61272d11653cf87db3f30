Muslim religious leaders have vowed to appeal the High Court ruling which ordered the Madrasah Taleemuddeen Islamic Institute to "tone down" prayer calls. JOHANNESBURG -Â A court has ordered a local mosque to stop using an external sound amplifier system for its calls following a complaint from a neighbour, a religious body said. Muslim religious leaders have vowed to appeal the High Court ruling which ordered the Madrasah Taleemuddeen Islamic Institute in KwaZulu-Natal to "tone down" prayer calls, deeming it "too loud". The ruling was handed down on Friday. "We find that judgment to be a poor judgment," South African Muslim Network chairman Faisal Suliman told AFP. "It's going to be appealed all the way to the constitutional court," he said.

He complained that the prayer call that goes off at 1.30am deprived him of enjoyment of his property rights. Court judge Sidwell Mngadi ruled that the proximity of the applicant's property to the mosque favoured the applicant's claim that "the call to prayer interferes with his private space". The court instructed that the mosque ensure the call to prayer is not heard within the applicant's house and limited each call to prayer to three-minutes. Suliman said was it was the first time in recent memory that someone has gone to court to stop a religious facility from performing part of its rituals.
