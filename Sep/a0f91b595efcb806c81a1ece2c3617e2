His condition has improved sufficiently for him to be moved out of intensive care. Bester's son Shaun spoke to eNCA about his dad's condition and explained what happened on Sunday during the attack. READ: Comrades champion Nick Bester attacked "He has been assaulted and robbed before, where they did take his bike 10 years ago, but not this time. He had his gun with him but he didn't see anyone coming from the back," Bester said. "There were three guys, they hit him with rocks. They tied him up, they took his gun. They hit him on the eye which actually broke the bone above his eye and the cheekbone. "They started to kick him, which then caused three of his ribs to break. Then they dragged him deeper into the bushes, on top of the mountain. "They forced him to give them the PINs of the bank cards that he had with him in his cellphone pocket. They tied him up, he gave them the PINs and they left him there all bleeding and battered." Bester was training for the Battle of the Sports event at the time.
