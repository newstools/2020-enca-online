READ: Xenophobia has no place in SA, says Pandor The group is expected to march on those country's embassies in Pretoria. It’s made inflammatory accusations on social media, using the hashtags 'Nigerians Must Go' and 'Zimbabwe Must Go', including that foreign nationals are guilty of human trafficking and ruining communities with drugs. But the organisers of the march insist they are not being xenophobic. They say the aim is to push for South Africans to be prioritised on home soil.
