She said she is not concerned with what she believes is a smear campaign by officials in her department, including her director-general. Officials have accused her of interfering and usurping their functions. "They can't handle me because I am disturbing the crooks. I am disturbing them from being corrupt, and that is why they are ganging up now, there is a fightback of saying the minister is interfering. I'm making interventions where I see things are going wrong. I will continue to intervene when I see things are wrong," she said. The minister said one of the key performance indicators for Public Works' senior managers is obtaining an unqualified audit for the department for the current financial year.
