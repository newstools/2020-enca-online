File: The City of Cape Town says its resources are stretched thin trying to prevent the illegal occupation of various parcels of land. CAPE TOWN - Police Minister Bheki Cele has stopped short of banning the City of Cape Town's law enforcement unit. During a parliamentary committee meeting on police, it was revealed that this unit may be operating without competency certificates and that its training has not been authorised by Cele. Eviction: Bulelani Qolani wants city held accountable City of Cape Town officials were hauled over the coals by Parliaments Committee on Police. Its law enforcement unit has been described as a law unto themselves. The unit has been involved in responding to land grabs, demolition of shacks and structures as well as protests. While the modus operandi of the city's law enforcement officers came under scrutiny, it was their legal standing that took centre stage. READ: City of Cape Town ordered to compensate evictees Cele said, "now the problem is in the Western Cape there are more enforcement officers than the metro which Ipid has no oversight and we have no better understanding who has oversight over them".
It was suggested that the law be amended urgently to allow for Independent Police Investigative Directorate to be able to inspect and investigate the unit.
Cele said that while the city has over a thousand law enforcement officers, it has since February, only produced 10 competency certificates. 
Mayor of Cape Town, Dan Plato said, "if it is found that the city is at fault I will do the necessary and let you have the certificates ASAP."
Cele has given the City of Cape Town an ultimatum, produce the competency certificates by Monday or face the might of the law. At the same time, the minister wants the matter to be resolved amicably.
