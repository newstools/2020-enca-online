Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - A Moroka Swallows legend hopes promotion to the Absa Premiership signals a return to the glory days for the club. Steve Sekano has lauded the work of chairperson David Mogashoa and Panyaza Lesufi in securing the club’s future. Sekano has now let out a sigh of relief following the promotion of the Dube Birds. “I was screaming, I was happy, I was excited, because of you know every time I’ve been moving around the streets, when I meet people, they will ask me ‘Steve, what is happening with Swallows?' and I will tell them ‘Swallows is coming back," says the former midfielder.

The return of Maswaiswai has had several false dawns in the last five years, including a 2017 campaign urging fans to buy a stake in the club. “It was important for them to do all those things because they wanted to see how many people are willing, and how many supporters are willing to be part of this, and they realised that a lot of people want Swallows back.” While some of the troubles faced by Swallows in recent years are not over, Sekano is hopeful. He believes the Dube Birds will soar and secure a long-term stay in top-flight football. Watch the video above for more on this story.
