The fate of the tournament remains up in the air with Victoria state battling a second wave of COVID-19, although the caseload is dropping.

Tiley has previously said contingency plans were in place for Melbourne Park, with reduced seating due to social distancing, players in a secure bio-security "bubble" and the likelihood of no overseas spectators. "Players, if they come to Melbourne they'll stay in Melbourne for 14 days and we'll create a bubble between the hotel, transport and the courts," he said Thursday.
