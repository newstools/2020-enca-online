Elementary school students arrive at school on the first day of the new semester in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province. BEIJING - Students in face masks returned to class in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the coronavirus first emerged last year, as the city opened schools and kindergartens for the first time in seven months. Nearly 1.4 million students resumed classes at some 2,800 kindergartens, primary and middle schools across the city, following the reopening of high schools in May.

Official figures show Wuhan accounted for 80 percent of China's more than 4,600 coronavirus-related deaths and was under a strict lockdown for more than two months from late January. China has now largely controlled the spread of the virus, and schools across the country -- which were closed in late January -- have gradually reopened.
