Former eThekwini Mayor, Zandile Gumede will be back in court on the 10th of December. Her case was postponed today to allow the state to finalise the forensic audit report. Gumede and 10 other officials are facing charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering. DURBAN - Former eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede believes the ANC is under attack. She was speaking to her supporters after a three-month postponement in her corruption case. Gumede and her 16 co-accused – including suspended city manager Sipho Nzuza – are linked to tender fraud running into hundreds of millions. READ: Gumede returns to court The investigation is complete but the State has requested time to finalise a forensic audit report estimated to be 350,000 pages long. If that report is not ready in three months' time, the defence will proceed with an application to hold an inquiry into the delays. Gumede’s support was clear outside court. READ: I am a servant of the people, Gumede says “We are at war and it's not a war against Zandile but the war is attacking the African National Congress," she said. "That's why I'm saying the ANC members in Durban and other regions if they stand up, stand up against cases such as these ones, they will save the ANC.” Gumede and her co-accused – who are all out on bail - are due back in court on 10 December.
