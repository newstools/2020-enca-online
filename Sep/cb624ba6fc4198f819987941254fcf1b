File: Media personality Somizi Mhlongo (C). JOHANNESBURG - Social media is divided over allegations of theft against Idols judge, Somizi Mhlongo. Producer Hastings Moeng says he pitched a light-hearted television show similar to Dinner at Somizi’s. The synopsis was sent to Somgaga in 2014, and the current producer in 2016. READ: SA lockdown: Mbalula takes aim at Somizi Moeng says he didn't receive a reply from the producers. However, a similar show is currently on television. Somizi, the producers, as well as Multichoice, are yet to respond to the allegations. On 28 July 2014, Hastings Moeng proposed #DinnerAtSomizis to Somizi & Themba. The description of the show is materially similar to the one now flighted (to the shock of Mr Moeng). See the 2014 email below and decide for yourself. (1/2) pic.twitter.com/QVcpJIAY8o
