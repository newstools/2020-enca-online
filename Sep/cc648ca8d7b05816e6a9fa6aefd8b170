Now what would you do if a stranger paid for your fuel? Well, one Christian organisation in the Vaal is doing exactly that today VANDERBIJLPARK - What's been a tough few months for South Africans during the coronavirus pandemic, a Christian organisation from Vanderbijlpark has decided to ‘fuel motorists spirits’. The organisation paid fuel for strangers to put a smile on their faces. Bayanda Maseko said the Tancredi Foundation handed R250.00 vouchers of fuel to 100 motorists. “We decided to come here in Vaal with some blessings and to put a smile on someone's face, especially in this difficult time where everyone is trying to recover.” Foundation, which normally focuses on helping those in need with food parcels, clothes, blankets, and other essentials decided to do things differently this time around.
