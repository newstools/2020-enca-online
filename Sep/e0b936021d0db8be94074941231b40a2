EFF leader, Julius Malema, says there was no need for him and his co-accused Mbuyiseni Ndlozi to be dragged to court. He was speaking outside the Randburg Magistrate court after a short appearance on assault charges. JOHANNESBURG - EFF leader Julius Malema has called for a fine against the governing ANC after senior members of the party caught a lift from the Defence Minister to Zimbabwe. The ANC is denying any wrongdoing.

"A Zimbabwean issue is a very urgent issue, it requires urgent attention," Malema said.

Anything that can help to restore sanity in Zimbabwe, we will support it as the EFF but to use the state resources by the leadership of the ANC... "I think it was irresponsible and we should not be too dramatic about it. We will ask the secretary of the defence to invoice the ANC so that it pays and does not repeat that mistake but going to Zimbabwe, even under lockdown regulations, it is necessary, it is urgent and, therefore, it will be reactionary to say the leaders should never have gone to Zimbabwe." Malema said the need to go to Zimbabwe was there, but the ANC used an unacceptable mode of transport.
