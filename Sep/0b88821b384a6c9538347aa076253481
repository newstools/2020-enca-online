Valtteri Bottas drives during the first practice session at the Mugello circuit ahead of the Tuscany Formula One Grand Prix in Scarperia e San Piero. MUGELLO - Valtteri Bottas maintained his recent habit of being fastest on Friday when he clocked the quickest lap in opening practice for this weekend's inaugural Tuscan Grand Prix. The Finn, in his Mercedes, clocked a best lap in one minute and 17.819 seconds at the sweeping Ferrari-owned Mugello circuit to outpace nearest rival Max Verstappen of Red Bull by 0.048 seconds. The track is being used for the first time as a Grand Prix venue to mark the celebrations for Ferrari’s 1,000th F1 race entry and sparked an improvement in the Italian team's fortunes as Charles Leclerc was third fastest for the ‘scarlet scuderia’, running in retro burgundy livery, three-tenths off the pace. It was the first time in three events that Ferrari had a car in the top ten after Friday morning practice — a welcome fillip for the team as they sought to bounce back from their pointless flops at Spa Francorchamps and Monza. Series leader and six-time champion Lewis Hamilton was fourth in the second Mercedes, half a second behind Bottas, ahead of Pierre Gasly of Alpha Tauri, Esteban Ocon of Renault, Daniil Kvyat in the second Alpha Tauri, Alex Albon of Red Bull and Daniel Ricciardo in the second Renault.
