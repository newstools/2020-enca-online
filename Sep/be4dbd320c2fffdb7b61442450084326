READ:Â DA leadership battle heats up He was one of the contenders for the party's federal leader position. The DA's Gauteng Leader, John Moodey, has quit the party. He says he no longer recognises it. Courtesy #DStv403 "I believe that there will be more leaders, more so black leaders who will be leaving the DA because just like me, they feel that this is no longer a political home for them." READ: Moodey resigns from the DA Moodey announced his resignation on Wednesday, saying the DA has become irrelevant. "I believe that the party has become irrelevant. We have gone through a bad patch in 2019. I believe that it was more internal causes than external. There were tensions between black and white. There were tensions between the right to centre liberals against us. It wasn't managed properly, and Mmusi had to go." The DA says Moodey's departure is unfortunate and unnecessary. Solly Msimanga will replace Moodey.
