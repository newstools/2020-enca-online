Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - It is common for people who have tested positive for COVID-19 to be reinfected, according to Vaccinologist, Professor Shabir Madhi. Madhi says this is nothing to worry about as people generally develop enough immunity to only present mild symptoms or be completely asymptomatic.

Madhi says it is important for people to continue adhering to the regulations. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday.
