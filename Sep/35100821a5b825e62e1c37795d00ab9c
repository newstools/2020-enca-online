JOHANNESBURG - The draw for the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France has been moved to December 14 due to the coronavirus pandemic, the tournament's chief executive, Claude Atcher, said on Monday. It was originally set for November 30 but has been postponed until after the Rugby Championship, which has been rescheduled due to the Covid-19 outbreak and is set to be completed on December 12, to take into account country seedings from that competition.
