JOHANNESBURG - Embattled Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku has threatened legal action against the DA’s Jack Bloom. This comes after the DA Gauteng health spokesperson published a statement, accusing Masuku’s department of spending almost R500,000 on each COVID-19 patient admitted at the Nasrec field hospital. Bloom says this is another reason why Masuku should be fired in addition to his failure to prevent alleged corruption in PPE contracts.
