BANGKOK - More than 100 diners craving in-flight meals after months of travel restrictions flocked to Thai Airways International Pcl's offices to try a new pop-up restaurant and get a reminder of the forgotten flavours of on-board dining. The national carrier, which has for months grounded most of its planes, has transformed the cafeteria of its Bangkok headquarters into an airline-themed restaurant and opened it to the public. "I ate a lot," said Pirachat Pengthongworrapetch, who heard about the restaurant online. "It's better here than in the air because it's cooked to order."
