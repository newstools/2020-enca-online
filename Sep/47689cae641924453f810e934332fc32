READ:Â South Africa to move to Lockdown Level 1 DA interim leader John Steenhuisen said, "we're certainly going to need a lot more than the Jerusalema to get the economy going forward again," referencing the president's parting remarks, encouraging South Africans to participate in the #JerusalemaChallege to show unity. "The more stimulation we can give the economy, the more investment we can make, and the more money we can spend on fixing the economy and cutting waste in the government, I think the better it's going to be going forward." We are finally in a downward trajectory to the end of a rather painful fight against the pandemic. The country will move to alert level one of the Covid-19 lockdown on Monday.

SUMMARY: SA ready to open our doors to the world, says Ramaphosa UDM leader General Bantu Holomisa also welcomed the shift to Alert Level 1. Regarding the implementation of the government's economic recovery plan, Holomisa said, "let's hope now that there has been a consensus reached on what kind of macroeconomic policy this country deserves to have. Otherwise, it will just be another talk shop." Holomisa encouraged the state to publicise its plans for infrastructure development and maintenance.
