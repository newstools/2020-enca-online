Liverpool's Egyptian midfielder Mohamed Salah celebrates after scoring their fourth goal, his third, from the penalty spot during the English Premier League football match between Liverpool and Leeds United at Anfield in Liverpool, north west England on September 12, 2020. LONDON - Mohamed Salah's hat-trick saved Liverpool from an opening day stumble as the defending Premier League champions edged Leeds 4-3 on Saturday, while Arsenal had a much more comfortable start against newly-promoted opposition with a 3-0 win at Fulham. Just 48 days after last season's delayed conclusion, the Premier League returned with a bang as Liverpool and Leeds, on their return to the top-flight after a 16-year absence, served up a feast of goals to open the 2020-21 campaign.

Salah won a fourth-minute penalty when his shot hit Leeds debutant Robin Koch on his outstretched arm and he dispatched the spot-kick himself. Leeds fashioned a stunning equaliser in the 12th minute when on-loan Manchester City midfielder Jack Harrison cut past Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joe Gomez before drilling a superb low finish into the bottom corner. Virgil van Dijk restored Liverpool's lead eight minutes later with a thumping header from Andy Robertson's corner. Leeds equalised again in the 30th minute when Van Dijk made a hash of a flicked attempt to clear and Patrick Bamford pounced to guide his shot past Alisson Becker. A remarkable game produced more drama as Salah struck again three minutes later with a thunderous drive into the roof of the net. Leeds equalised for a third time when Mateusz Klich made a well-timed run to meet Helder Costa's pass with a composed finish in the 66th minute.

"Leeds are special. I said it before the game and in the game everybody saw it obviously," said Klopp admiringly of Bielsa's men. "The way they play, the way they defend, the way they go into challenges was really, really good – and for 95 minutes, by the way! "I’m completely fine with the game. Offensively, it was good; and defensively, we can improve and we will improve." Arsenal's Gabonese striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (R) celebrates scoring their third goal with Arsenal's Brazilian midfielder Willian (L) during the English Premier League football match between Fulham and Arsenal at Craven Cottage in London on September 12, 2020. At Craven Cottage, Arsenal hit the ground running with the kind of confident display that has become their hallmark since Mikel Arteta took charge. Willian starred on his Gunners debut with three assists for Alexandre Lacazette, fellow new-signing Gabriel Magalhaes and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. After winning the FA Cup in his debut campaign, Arteta's next task is to return Arsenal to the Champions League next season and the Spaniard promised more good news with captain Aubameyang getting ever closer to agreeing a new contract. "I'm really positive we are going to get it done very soon and hopefully in the next few days you will get some news," Arteta told BT Sport.

Despite a proposed Saudi-backed takeover of the club not going through, the Magpies do appear to have recruited well in the transfer market. England international Callum Wilson got his first goal for the club early in the second half before Jeff Hendrick also marked his debut with a stunning strike to secure all three points for Steve Bruce's men. Wilfried Zaha's goal was enough to earn Crystal Palace a 1-0 win over Southampton at Selhurst Park
