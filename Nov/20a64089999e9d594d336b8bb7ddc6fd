Myeni invoked her right to silence on the matter. She says she does not want to incriminate herself since there’s a court order out for her on the matter. READ: Dudu Myeni declared delinquent director "I highly respect this commission, I always act responsibly and I am willing and have committed to present myself to this commission so that we deal, once and for all, with everything that has been said and all the false accusations and insinuations about me in my absence," Myeni said. "But now the problem I have is that the court judgment, which I have been advised to appeal is before the commission and it's known and it's public and therefore I would like to exercise my right and answer where I can." Myeni has been implicated by several witnesses at the state capture inquiry.
