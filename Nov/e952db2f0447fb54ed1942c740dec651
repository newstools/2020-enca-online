We acknowledge that the headline and intro to the story was not accurate and could easily be open to misinterpretation. We acknowledge that the coach is not leaving the club and rather has been granted a leave of absence to attend to a personal matter in Germany. For this, we extend an apology to Orlando Pirates Football Club, the chairman, the coach Josef Zinnbauer and the fans.
