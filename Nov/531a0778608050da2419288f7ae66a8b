AFP/Toshifumi Kitamura TOKYO - Boxing legend Floyd Mayweather will return to the ring with a fight in Tokyo in February 2021, organisers said, but who he will fight and under what rules was left unclear. The retired ex-champ had already dropped hints about the fight, which follows a widely ridiculed 2018 "exhibition" match against a Japanese kickboxer, but organisers offered more details on Monday. It will be part of an event dubbed "Mega 2021", being hosted at the Tokyo Dome in the Japanese capital on February 28, the production committee said in a press release.

Last week the 43-year-old shared a video on Instagram teasing the fight. "Tokyo, Japan, I'm coming back, in 2021," he said in the clip. "I know the Olympics is in Japan in 2021, but me, myself, Floyd 'Money' Mayweather and my team will be doing something big in Tokyo Dome... Japan, I'm on my way." Mayweather retired three years ago, and although he had previously announced he was "coming out of retirement in 2020", he hasn't been seen in action this year.
