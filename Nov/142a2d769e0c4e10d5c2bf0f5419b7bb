The Cape Town lad even scored a place at one of the most prestigious choir schools in the country. But could his financial circumstances put an end to this once in a lifetime chance? Ethan Palagangwe earned a top spot at the prestigious Drakensberg Boys Choir School. From about 1,600 hopeful students, Ethan is one of only 30 who got accepted. "I feel so great about the school and how my parents are supporting me," Ethan said. "I’m going to miss my parents but I’m going to very strong, I'm not going to be like a small baby I'm going assist myself at that school." But Ethan’s big plans and opportunities could come to a halt without funding. “I'm very grateful for the opportunity that my son was given. Being the only breadwinner it makes it highly impossible for me to afford the school fees, I mean it’s a lot of money per annum," said Ethan's father Kagisho. "Does it mean the financial constraints that we in, makes it impossible for our son not to attend that school? After going through all that avenues does it mean it stops here? "It’s very heart-breaking but we asking everyone out there.” * eNCA's Tanya Nefdt reports.
