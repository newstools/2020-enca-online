AFP/Saeed Khan TOKYO -Â Sony's PlayStation 5 went on sale on Thursday, just two days after rival Microsoft released its newest Xbox, with the next-generation consoles vying for holiday season dominance as the pandemic boosts gaming demand. With pre-orders pointing to a record launch, market leader Sony is counting on big-ticket exclusive games like "Spider-Man: Miles Morales" to keep the edge over its US challenger. With coronavirus cases rising in many countries, launch events are off the table, and crowds of eager customers out of the question. While the new Xbox hit shelves worldwide on Tuesday, the PS5 is available from Thursday in Australia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, North America and South Korea, but gamers elsewhere will have to wait until 19 November. The consoles go on sale with the pandemic creating a massive spike in demand for gaming from people stuck at home and looking for a distraction or a way to pass the time. Just how long that boom will last remains unclear, with news this week of progress on a virus vaccine prompting a gaming sector sell-off on stock markets, as investors anticipated a return to normal life. The PS5 is priced at $500, like the Xbox Series X, while a version without a disk reader costs $400. That is more than the $300 price tag for Microsoft's less powerful Xbox Series S, which also has no disk reader.
