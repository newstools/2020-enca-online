Courtesy #DStv403 DURBAN - A former police spokesperson who was jailed over a fake matric certificate, has now earned a real one. Vincent Mdunge served two years in prison and a further year on parole. When news of his fake matric certificate surfaced, it led to his resignation in 2013. A year later, Mdunge was convicted of fraud.
"When I went to prison I said show me the school, and I went and enrolled," Mdunge said. When he joined the police in the 80s, a matric certificate wasn't a requirement but it was when he was promoted to colonel.
Mdunge believes he was targeted over that post.
"I know fundamentally my incarceration was as a result of a post that was desired and destined for another woman," Mdunge said. The former policeman, convicted fraudster and now businessman said he still believes in the rule of law and doesn't want anyone to end up in prison.
"It brings a lot of mayhem, trauma and disgrace and people must live honest lives and be truthful to themselves."* eNCA's Dasen Thathiah reports. Watch the video above.
