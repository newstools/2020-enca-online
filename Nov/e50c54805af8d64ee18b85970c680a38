Courtesy #DStv403  CAPE TOWN - Current and former pupils are accusing Brackenfell High School of turning a blind eye to racism. A memorandum of complaints has been sent to the school, but pupils say there's been no response or accountability. A matric pupil says the private party that sparked protests was just the tip of the school's racist culture.

"There were countless complaints that were brought to the school's attention, but they didn't do anything about it," the pupil said. "I feel like the school can react in a much better way, I feel like they can actually listen to our voices and take our feeling into consideration. "Not just the image of the school, because that's all they're worried about."

"My sister was in the school 10 years ago and she experienced racism, the student that called her a k-word got two days of suspension. "After that he came back to school taunting her. I matriculated in 2016 and in 2020 we are experiencing racism," Ntuntwana said. "It just shows that racism still runs in Brackenfell and it's managed to be a culture and tradition." The Western Cape education department says it's spoken to the school and pupils to ensure that those who experience or see discrimination have a way to be heard. * eNCA's Nobesuthu Hejana reports.
