Political analyst Lukhona Mnguni weighed in, saying, "we are coming from a moment where these law enforcement agencies were indeed hollowed out and used as political vehicles in overt ways. "If you look at how some cases were suppressed and some were attempted to be accelerated. So we are not over that era, but I think there has been some cleanup of those agencies."
Magashule maintains he has not done anything wrong as a law-abiding citizen of South Africa.
