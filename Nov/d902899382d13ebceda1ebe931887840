It comes after an animal rights activist took the City of Cape Town to court. Thousands of animal lovers signed a petition for Kataza to be removed from Tokai, where he'd been relocated.
The City initially said Kataza had to be relocated to Tokai because he was raiding bins in Kommetjie and splintering the Slangkop troupe.
But Kataza never joined the bigger troupe at his new location.
Animal rights activist Ryno Engelbrecht brought a court application against Cape Town's baboon technical team and on Friday the city settled the case.

"Before relocation, his tags have to be taken off him and he will be seen to by a vet so see to that he doesn't need veterinary care."
Kataza has been roaming the streets of Tokai for more than 70 days now but by the end of the week he should finally be making the journey home to Kommetjie. Sadly, he will not be able to reunite with his family in the Slangkop troupe as his young were killed without his protection.
Engelbrecht says it is unfair that baboons from conservation areas are being punished for the behaviour of their human neighbours.* eNCA's Nadine Theron reports.
