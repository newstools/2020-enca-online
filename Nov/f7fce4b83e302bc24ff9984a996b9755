Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee has elected its new leadership, at its AGM on Saturday afternoon. Barry Hendricks is Sascoc's new president, assuming the role having previously served on an interim basis. Two women have been elected as vice-presidents. READ: Entire CSA board resigns The sports mother body has a five to three gender split on its board, with five women and three men. The election comes after a year of turmoil that has split the organisation. The in-fighting has hampered Sascoc's ability to see out its core administrative functions.
Hendricks had no words of comfort for the organisation, saying, "we've lost focus on the federations, we've lost focus on our finances, we've lost focus on the intent of our strategic plan which was presented to you, and we've lost focus in terms of restructuring this organisation. We presented a restructuring plan to you, I think it was last year, and you accepted that plan to restructure Sascoc.  We have not been able to achieve that goal." "COVID-19 amongst other major factors, internal turmoil, has ensured that those particular aspects of change have been blocked."
