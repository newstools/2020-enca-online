AFP/Alejandro Pagni SYDNEY -Â A wounded All Blacks are desperate to restore pride against Argentina on Saturday after a shock loss to Australia, with the Pumas facing a huge task to pull off their first-ever win against the three-time world champions. The South Americans have failed to beat New Zealand in 29 Tests and head into their opening Tri-Nations clash at Sydney's Bankwest Stadium with the odds heavily stacked against them. After not playing a Test since the World Cup last year, and a build-up badly disrupted by the coronavirus, they face a battle-hardened team stung by a 24-22 loss to the Wallabies last week. In an ominous sign, New Zealand coach Ian Foster has named a near full-strength side after his eight changes to the starting team last week backfired. The All Blacks were not sharp enough against Australia, hampered by poor discipline and tactical awareness, with 10 players purged in response. "We were bitterly disappointed with the loss against Australia on the weekend, but we've taken a lot of lessons from that game," Foster said. "Specifically, we need to be smarter in seeing space and executing our plan around that." New Zealand have not lost back-to-back Tests since 2011 and have playmaker Richie Mo'unga and bruising winger Caleb Clarke returning to help prevent that happening again. They also have a new-look front row of Tyrel Lomax, Dane Coles and Joe Moody, who returns after a head knock.
