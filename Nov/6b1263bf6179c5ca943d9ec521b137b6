Courtesy #DStv403 PRETORIA - Are armed escorts the solution to the ongoing attacks on trucks? Truck driving on the country’s main logistics routes has become a dangerous and even deadly career. The recent spate of truck attacks has demonstrated the vulnerability of the drivers and their cargo. One option is to hire an armed escort.

The job involves far more than guns and armour. According to Robbie Roberts, it relies on the ability of the expertly trained guards to think on their feet. READ: Truck attacks: Ministers say criminality must stop “The most important part is communication between yourself and the driver to discuss which route you are taking," Roberts said. "Depending on the value of the truck, decide how many escorts there are going to be. And from there your communication to say I will observe from this side and you observe from the other side. "Then you rotate around the truck to ensure you don’t get caught static behind the truck so they can’t block you in.” Roberts wouldn't reveal how much such a service costs.

This only highlights the need for authorities to urgently secure the country’s roads and prosecute the criminals responsible for what's being termed economic sabotage. * eNCA’s Barry Bateman reports.
