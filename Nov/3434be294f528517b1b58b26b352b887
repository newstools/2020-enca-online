The Currie Cup will run from 17 November to 23 January. BackpagePix/Christiaan Kotze JOHANNESBURG - Carling Black Label announced they will sponsor the Currie Cup for three years, giving South African rugby a desperately-needed cash boost. SA Rugby had to slash R1.2-billion off the budget for this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. No rugby was played in the home of the reigning world champions from mid-March to late September, forcing the Springboks to withdraw from the Rugby Championship and losing a quarter of the anticipated profits. One report said SA Rugby stood to pocket R300-million if they had taken part, but a lack of competitive game-time meant the risks to the players were too great. "What makes this sponsorship even more significant is that Carling Black Label has partnered with us during one of the toughest economic climates in sport and business," said SA Rugby CEO Jurie Roux.

No financial details were disclosed at the announcement in Johannesburg, but an official said the sponsorship will greatly reduce the competition costs incurred by SA Rugby. The Currie Cup will run from November 27 to January 23 between the Bulls, Cheetahs, Griquas, Lions, Pumas, Sharks and Stormers with up to 14 World Cup-winning Springboks on view, including captain Siya Kolisi. The first Currie Cup matches were played in 1989 with four South African regions competing, three of whom will take part this season.
