A metro train that shot through a stop block at De Akkers metro station was saved from disaster by a sculpture of a whale tail. AFP/Robin Utrecht/ANP ROTTERDAM -Â A runaway Dutch metro train was saved from disaster on Monday after it smashed through a stop barrier but then came to rest on a giant sculpture of a whale's tail. Instead of crashing into the water 10 metres below, the front carriage ended up suspended dramatically in the air, propped up only by the silver cetacean. The driver of the train, which had no passengers on board, was unharmed in the fluke incident which happened just after midnight at Spijkenisse, near the port city of Rotterdam. In a twist of fate, the fortuitously positioned artwork is called "Saved by the Whale's Tail". "This is such a weird scenario," Carly Gorter of the Rijnmond regional safety authority told AFP. "The metro went off the rails and it landed on a monument called Saved by the Whale's Tail. So that literally happened. "Because of the whale's tail the driver actually was saved, it's incredible." The driver was later held for questioning, the safety authority said. The cause of the crash was still being investigated. "The driver is going to the police station to ask him about his story. So this is normal procedure for these kind of accidents," said Gorter. The sculpture was built in a park underneath the raised metro, its name a deliberate play on the fact that it is a "tail track" at the end of the line after De Akkers metro station. It features two large whale tails poking out of the water, one of which saved the train. A team of emergency services and experts, including the architect, was now on site to work out how to safely remove the train.
