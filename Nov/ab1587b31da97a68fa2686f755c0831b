Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Local pilots spent the last couple of months delivering essential goods to remote areas of South Africa. Now they are making dreams come true by giving orphans and underprivileged kids the flight of their lives. The Orient Airfield in Magaliesburg was this year's location for The Children's Flight. The annual initiative was launched in 2015 to give underprivileged children the chance to dance in the clouds.
The 20 pilots gladly sacrificed their time to put smiles on the children's faces.
The day ended on another high note for the kids with aerobatics by the Flying Lions, South Africa's very own aerobatic team. * Gerhard Pretorius reports. Watch the video above.
