File: Players will be confined to bio-secure bubbles during the tour as they were during the English international season. AFP/Pool LONDON - England's Jofra Archer, Ben Stokes and Sam Curran will be rested from the one-day international leg of the 50-over world champions' tour of South Africa, it was announced on Tuesday. But the three players were all included in the squad for the three Twenty20s, which start later this month, ahead of the three-match ODI series. Players will be confined to bio-secure bubbles during the tour as they were during the English international season. Archer, Stokes and Curran have all been in a new bubble while taking part in the Indian Premier League tournament, which is being staged in the United Arab Emirates on health grounds. Fast bowler Archer spent 87 days in the England bubble, although he was ruled out of the second Test against the West Indies in Manchester in July after breaching Covid-19 regulations. All-rounder Stokes missed a chunk of the English season to spend time with his ill father in New Zealand but left-arm seamer Curran appeared in both red and white-ball internationals. Archer, speaking last week, said bubble life had been tough even though at the IPL team hotels are away from the grounds and not on-site as they were in England. "You're not at the ground but you still can't get away from cricket," he explained.  "It's OK and it will be over soon anyway. You're just counting days down till you're free again." England's matches in South Africa will be staged at Boland Park in Paarl and Newlands, in Cape Town. Newlands will stage both the opening T20 on November 20 and the first ODI on December 4.
