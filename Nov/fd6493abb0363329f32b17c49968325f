READ: Trump says Biden 'rushing to falsely pose' as US election winner "The work ahead of us will be hard, but I promise you this: I will be a President for all Americans -- whether you voted for me or not," the 77-year-old former vice president said in a tweet. "With the campaign over, it's time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation," he said in a separate statement. "It's time for America to unite. And to heal." US Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris on Saturday called on Americans to "get started" with the work ahead after networks projected that Democrat Joe Biden, her running mate, defeated Republican incumbent Donald Trump. "This election is about so much more than @JoeBiden or me. It's about the soul of America and our willingness to fight for it," tweeted Harris, a US senator from California and the first woman of color to be elected to the vice presidency. "We have a lot of work ahead of us. Let's get started."
