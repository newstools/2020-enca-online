READ: Lesufi explains challenges facing online application process Lesufi said, "we had more applications than the number of classrooms that we had. This has created a huge headache for the department, the officials, and the parents. "We are aware that parents are in a panic mode. Many parents are angry and the anxiety has reached unacceptable levels." "Accordingly, parents who have received offers for placement from 1 October 2020 and did not accept were forfeited after seven days of receipt. Based on the capacity of each school to accommodate learners, offers were released to qualifying parents." "We can confidently inform parents that out the 181,119 applications were properly placed and unfortunately, 41,146 parents have not received their placements. Of the total number that we received, we have managed to place 81 percent. We are now left with 18 percent of parents that are not placed."
