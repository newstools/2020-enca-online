AFP/James Gilbert LOS ANGELES - Mike Tyson says he never imagined as a heavyweight boxing champion that he would climb into the ring with Roy Jones Jr. at age 54 as he does on Saturday. Fifteen years after retiring with a 2005 loss to journeyman Kevin McBride, Tyson makes a comeback after dropping 100 pounds and returning to training. "I didn't think I'd live that long. It was so intense," Tyson said in a news conference ahead of the eight-round fight in Los Angeles. READ: Mike Tyson to make boxing comeback against Roy Jones "Me just existing is a success." Tyson said his hunger has returned 15 years after finishing his career. "I don't know who I was then. I'm just very comfortable with who I am now," Tyson said. "My last fight, I didn't have no interest in it. I'm interested now." Tyson, 50-6 with 44 knockouts, plans to take the fight to 51-year-old Jones, 66-9 with 47 knockouts, from the start. "I'm just going to go right at him at the bell and see what happens," Tyson said. "It's going to be entertaining. He's a fighter. I'm a fighter. We're in there throwing punches. Anything can happen."
