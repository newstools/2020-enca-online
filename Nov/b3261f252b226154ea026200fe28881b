Potatoes SA blames the surge in prices on an unusually cold winter in Limpopo, where most of the country's potatoes are produced. READ: Potatoes deserve to be a part of the super-food family "With the demand normalising with people getting used to living with COVID-19 and the new regulations, the supply kept on reducing and we saw a steep increase from June as the demand started normalising and that caused the high prices with the lower volumes," said Chief Commercial Officer of Grow Fresh Produce Agents, Deon van Zyl. "As Potatoes South Africa has indicated previously, is that the supply or lack of supply was basically due to cold weather and with the demand normalising you have an actual spike because of supply and demand." READ: How the coronavirus crisis is affecting food supply Van Zyl says there is a potential for prices to decrease over the next few weeks as supply increases. "We have already in the last two to three weeks seen an increase in supply so the prices naturally came down and so I think in October and going forward in November, we will see a definite decrease in potato prices and normalising to normal prices," he said.
