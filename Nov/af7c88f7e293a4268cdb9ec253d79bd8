Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Malawian government has issued a statement, expressing concern about the treatment President Lazarus Chakwera received when leaving the country. Chakwera's presidential envoy was subjected to additional security checks and searches which the statement called improper and incongruous with the treatment they received when entering the country. READ: Malawi denies claims Bushiri took a ride with President Chakwera "The government of Malawi is aware and grateful that a public statement was recently issued by the South African government, exculpating President Chakwera from false allegations dominating the South African media that his presidential plane was used as a conduit for trafficking two Malawians [Shepherd and Mary Bushiri] wanted by South African authorities," the statement read. It went on to say the response from the South African government fell short of acknowledging the poor treatment received by Chakwera.

The Bushiris contravened their bail conditions as they are not allowed to travel outside South Africa. READ: Cele: Bushiris shouldn't have been granted bail Last week, the couple was granted bail of R200,000 each. They're facing charges of theft, money laundering and fraud in connection with an alleged R100-million investment scheme. *eNCA's Dan Moyane spoke with an immigration lawyer on the extradition process.
