AFP/Ernesto Benavides PERU - Mists hung low over Machu Picchu, adding an eerie, otherworldly atmosphere as delighted tourists entered the iconic Inca citadel for the first time after eight months of lockdown due to the coronavirus. Two couples from France and Chile were the lucky first visitors to the UNESCO World Heritage site. They were brought to the ruins by bus from the tiny Machu Picchu Pueblo village at the foot of the 2,400-meter mountain atop which the ruins sit. Peru ordered a total lockdown and closed its borders in March. It has since become one of the worst-affected countries in Latin America, with the highest mortality rate in the world, after the tiny republic of San Marino.

"It was a surprise to see that effectively we were the first international tourists to enter this complex," Chilean Juan Jose Garcia told AFP. "I feel lucky to be able to visit here without people," added his wife Victoria Moran. The citadel's eight-month isolation was nothing compared to the four centuries it lay covered by dense vegetation before being rediscovered by American explorer Hiram Bingham in 1911.

Now, visitors and staff must pass through a temperature control before entering the site. It took a couple of hours for the low-lying clouds to lift and reveal the famous Huayna Picchu peak that provides the backdrop to the typical postcard picture of the site.
