Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo addressed the state capture commission on his relationship with former president Jacob Zuma on Monday. Zondo said he met with Zuma 13 to 14 years ago but has not had any other one-on-one meetings with him. LIVESTREAM: Zuma appears before Zondo Commission The meetings all reportedly happened more than 13 years ago. "It is true that Mr Zuma and I have known each other since the early 1990s. From then until 1997 when he was appointed as a judge," Zondo said. "Since then his interactions were of a personal nature. It has been cordial and pleasant." The deputy justice said Zuma's statement that they are friends is not accurate.

Zondo outlined previous cases where he has presided over matters involving associates of Zuma, including his son Duduzane, and stated in none of the matters was he asked to recuse himself. Advocate Muzi Sikhakhane, representing Zuma, explained the reasons for the application and said the team does not bring this application lightly and is not intended to impune the judge's integrity. Sikhakhane said the inquiry is being used by South African media to advance the narrative that Zuma is "the man who messed up the country".
