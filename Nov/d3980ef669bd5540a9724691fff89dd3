Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Self-proclaimed prophet, Shepherd Bushiri, is adamant he's not running away from his trial in South Africa. He says he isÂ in Malawi to seek intervention from his home country. WATCH: Bushiri on his departure from SA "If I wanted to run away, I would not have come to Malawi. Running away, you go to a country where you don't tell people where you are. Right now, I'm informing the whole world that I'm in Malawi." Bushiri says he doesn't feel safe in South Africa and that February this year, he "almost got shot in Sandton" and authorities have done nothing about it. Malawi Information Minister, Gospel Kazako, speaks to eNCA's Faith Mangope following claims Propher Shepherd Bushiri took a ride on President Lazarus Chakwera's plane out of South Africa. Less than a week ago, Bushiri was granted bail which prohibits him and other co-accused, from leaving the country. Meanwhile, the Malawian government has called on South Africa to make a formal request for self-proclaimed Prophet, Shepherd Bushiri's extradition. That's according to Malawi's Information Minister, Gospel Kazako. READ: Malawi: SA has not engaged with us Kazako says they have not yet received any communication from the South African government. "We don't know how he got into Malawi. You must know he was living in South Africa. He started his journey from South Africa. You also have to be asking the South African authorities how he managed to come into Malawi. We do not know." Kazako told eNCA they had no involvement in assisting Bushiri to skip the country. eNCA has not yet received a response from the SA government regarding this matter.
