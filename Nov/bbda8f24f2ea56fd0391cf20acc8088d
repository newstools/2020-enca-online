Tigers do not exist in the wild in Africa, and not many people have had a chance to see them. Tourism is one of Uganda’s biggest revenue earners but the industry has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Two Bengal Tigers at Uganda’s only public zoo are raising conservation hopes. They were brought in from the Mystic Monkeys and Feathers Zoo in South Africa after being exchanged with 25 monkeys from Uganda. The Entebbe Zoo where the tigers are being kept expects to increase visitors numbers with this new wildlife attraction. Zoo caretakers say the tigers are responding well to the climate here. Uganda’s Zoo hopes it will be able to increase the tiger population and in return, boost tourism. * Isabel Nakirya reports from Uganda.
