His walk-out out of the state capture inquiry defies the commission's summons for him to testify. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo earlier dismissed Zuma's application for his recusal from the commission.

"The application for my recusal falls... and it is accordingly dismissed," ruled Zondo. Zuma filed an additional affidavit this week in which he says Zondo was downplaying their relationship, insisting they are friends. WATCH: Zondo to rule on recusal application Zondo denied this claim and said, "the applicant cannot be allowed to raise this issue [personal relationship] so late in the day." Zuma's lawyer Muzi Sikhakhane told Zondo "you have become a judge in a dispute that involves yourself." Sikhakhane requested proceedings be suspended so that he could review the judgment.

Zondo was dismayed at Zuma's apparent walkout. "It is a pity that he has elected to leave without asking for permission," Zondo said. "This is a serious matter." The commission will not sit on Friday. - Additional information AFP
