The staff of Livingstone Hospital Resource Centre are demanding decent salaries. Nehawu members have been on strike since Wednesday last week. READ: Mkhize visits EC hospitals as COVID-19 cases continue to rise "Nehawu is currently on strike nationally, demanding that healthcare workers must be made permanent and must be paid decent salaries because as we speak they are getting paid R3,500, there are no benefits," said Nehawu regional secretary, Sweetness Stokwe. "If someone reaches the age of 60-years, the only thing they get from the department is a letter thanking them for their service, they don't even get a cent." The health workers have also accused the minister of ignoring their plight.
