The DA, fresh from electing a new leader, is gearing up to defend its traditional strongholds in Lenasia, Eldorado Park and Riverlea in Johannesburg. The parties will be doing battle for 95 wards across the country, with most of the action happening the Eastern Cape.

In the 2016 local elections, the DA won 48-percent of the vote in Lenasia while Al-Jama won just 2-percent but the blue party is now under threat. The big parties are sceptical that small parties like Al-Jama will shift the political paradigm like the independents did in 2016 but this will be clearer after next Wednesday’s vote. eNCA's Govan Whittles. Watch the video above.
