File: ArcelorMittal said sales hit $13.3-billion, which was nearly a 21 percent jump from the second quarter, but were still a fifth below the level of last year. AFP/Tiziana Fabi PARIS - Steel giant ArcelorMittal said it cut its net loss in half during the third quarter as demand rose with major economies exiting coronavirus lockdowns. The net loss of $261-million was also half of the net loss posted in the July to September period of 2019. On an operating basis, however, the firm bounced back into profit of $718-million when many major economies shut many businesses, dampening demand for steel.

ArcelorMittal said sales hit $13.3-billion, which was nearly a 21 percent jump from the second quarter, but were still a fifth below the level of last year. That beat the analyst consensus of $12.8-billion compiled by Bloomberg.
