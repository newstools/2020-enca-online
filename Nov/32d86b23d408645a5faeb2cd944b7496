George Russell lost control of his car while weaving and accelerating to warm the tyres and squirted off into a wall. AFP/Davide Gennari IMOLA - Lewis Hamilton and Romain Grosjean messaged their support to George Russell on Monday after his crash behind the safety car in this weekend's Emilia Romagna Grand Prix. Russell was 10th and likely to claim his first point in Formula One and Williams' of the season when he lost control of his car while weaving and accelerating to warm the tyres, and squirted off into a wall. He climbed out and sat by the track with his head in his hands before returning to the pits. The six-time world champion told his fellow-Briton it was "OK to make mistakes and to feel the pain," adding he had "to keep his head up and keep on pushing." Grosjean was compassionate after crashing out of a points position behind a Safety Car in Azerbaijan two years ago. "Man, I know the feeling," he said "It will take some time to forget it, but what you do is mega. Keep pushing." Russell later described the incident as "the biggest mistake I've ever made in my career." Ironically, the Englishman is one of a clutch of highly-rated young drivers tipped to be championship challengers in the future – with Russell, as a Mercedes protege, well-positioned to take a seat in their factory race outfit.
