BERN - Russia will attempt to overturn its four-year ban from the international sport this week in the latest chapter of a long-running and controversial saga over state-sanctioned doping. Global anti-doping body WADA in December last year declared the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to be non-compliant after being accused of manipulating testing data. The ban meant the country would miss the Tokyo Olympics as well as football's 2022 World Cup in Qatar and the 2022 Winter Olympics in China. This week's Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) hearing, which is expected to last until Friday, has already caused division. READ: Russia banned from Olympics for four years over doping scandal - TASS "WADA had requested that the hearing be held in public but for that to happen all parties were required to be in agreement and that was not the case," said a WADA statement. Instead, and in keeping with the 'Cold War-style' of the case, the hearing will take place behind closed doors and at a secret location. A decision will only be made public on an undisclosed date. Russia considers its ban to be legally indefensible.
