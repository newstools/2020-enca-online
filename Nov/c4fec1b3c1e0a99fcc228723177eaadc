JOHANNESBURG -Â South Africa needs to address its bloated public sector wage bill urgently, according to Business Unity South Africa. Busa has released its findings and says reducing the wages of public servants is crucial in the country's economic recovery. It warns that the current levels of public servant pay are unaffordable. The report has found that government wages are well above global norms, and have grown rapidly without any reference to increased productivity.
