Lwandile Simelane, newly elected Sascoc vice-president spoke with eNCA's Hloni Mtimkulu on the organisation's plans for the future. #Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Sascoc newly-elected vice-president, Lwandile Simelane is still basking in the glow of victory.
Simelane said, "I'm still very excited, I think I'll settle down when the work really starts." READ: Sascoc, CSA on collision course Simelane's election to the second most senior position at Sascoc is significant, especially given the officials that have come before her. The former hockey player and youth sports promoter is looking to find the balance between that significance and the work ahead in the embattled organisation.

The Barberton-born sports enthusiast re-joined the Sascoc board at a time when the organisation is scarred from years of infighting.
"If the matters in the boardroom are always focused on the proliferation of sport and the proliferation of the athlete, then I don't think that the rest of the stuff would ever take its eye off the mark," she said.
Governance shortcomings have been flagged in the past, and 34-year old Simelane hopes to use her experience in that area to benefit the organisation."It's about giving the organisation a very strong policy framework and ensuring that we're working on a good academic platform because we can be passionate about what we do, but if we're not processed correctly, then the wheels tend to come off as we've seen time and time again." Simelane is determined to lead Sascoc to better times as well as working on new funding models for the future.
