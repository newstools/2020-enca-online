AFP/Alexander Joe JOHANNESBURG - It will end in tears for one of the Soweto Giants on Sunday afternoon when they go toe-to-toe in the MTN8 semi-final second leg clash. Orlando Pirates have one foot in the final after humbling Kaizer Chiefs by three goals to nil in last weekend's first leg tie. Kaizer Chiefs have been guilty of not taking their chances and it was evident during the match against their archrivals. This time around the match will be played at FNB Stadium, with Amakhosi needing a miracle to overturn a three-nil scoreline.
"We certainly need to try and take our opportunities when we get them," said Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt.

The Buccaneers are in the driving seat ahead of the match. They've also recorded a morale-boosting win in the league in the midweek match against Bloem Celtic. But they are not underestimating their cross-town rivals.
 
"We know this is a team that were 20 minutes from winning the league," said Fadlu Davids, Pirates assistant coach. "The quality of the players have not changed at all, it's exactly the same team."
