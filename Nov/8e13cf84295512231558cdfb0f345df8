File: European unions have been particularly badly affected due to the ban on spectators attending matches. LONDON - The financial fallout for rugby from the coronavirus pandemic has been "devastating" with World Rugby effectively operating like a "central bank", the governing body's CEO Brett Gosper said on Monday. European unions have been particularly badly affected due to the ban on spectators attending matches since the season resumed in mid-August after it was originally halted by the coronavirus outbreak in March. Fans did, however, attend the recent Bledisloe Cup games hosted by New Zealand and will also be permitted when Australia host the Rugby Championship.

"It has been devastating from a revenue point of view," the Australian said in a conference call. "The more reliant you are on game hospitality and ticketing particularly, the more devastating it will be. "In the near future we are going to be getting some good broadcast revenues but the rest of the picture is pretty weak."

"We are contributing to about 30 unions, in particular 20, and probably the majority does go to the top 10 unions because it's where the majority of the revenue is," he said. "They generate a lot of the revenue for other unions, whether it comes from World Cups or elsewhere."
