Great white sharks have been disappearing from False Bay in the Cape. And fishermen and shark-cage diving operators are blaming one another. The conservation crisis has resulted in the national action plan for sharks being reviewed. Nadine Theron reports.

The vanishing of great whites from the coastal sites False Bay and Gansbaai had previously been blamed on illegal hunting and overfishing, among other causes. But the results of a study conducted by a government-appointed team of nine local and international experts suggest that orcas could be the culprits, after a pair of killer whales was first sighted in the area in 2015.

The number of great whites in the area is not known, but spotters initially reported steep declines in 2017 -- then an extended absence. The remains of five great white sharks killed by orcas were discovered in the Gansbaai area in 2017.

"Each and every time that this happened, there was an immediate drop and gap in white sharks sighting," Kock said, conceding that "we still don't have all the answers". Great white sharks are a big tourist attraction in South Africa -- they are viewed from boats or from cages lowered into the water.
