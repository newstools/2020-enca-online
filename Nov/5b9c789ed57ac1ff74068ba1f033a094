Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Cyclists in Cape Town are riding in fear. They’ve recently become targets for criminals who are attacking them and stealing their expensive bicycles and cellphones. A local cycling association is now calling on authorities to protect riders. For Faiek Davids, who has been cycling for 35 years, what used to be his favourite outdoor activity has become his worst nightmare. His bike was stolen and he spent two weeks in hospital with a broken ankle as a result of an attack.

"Me and him, we tumbled down the slope with the bicycle and all. And with that my ankle broke, I couldn’t move and I couldn’t stand.” Pedal Power Association says it has identified hotspots and wants authorities to protect cyclists. “At the moment the hotspot is just outside the American consulate in Tokai, that’s a big hotspot at the moment," said the association's chairman Stephen Hayward. "The hotspot again is just before Ocean View, Kommetjie area, that also another hotpot, we had to have people escorted out of the area." * eNCA’s Nobesuthu Hejana reports.
