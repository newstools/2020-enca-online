Mbali Ntuli and John Steenhuisen faced off on the first day of the DA’s virtual congress. Months after Mmusi Maimane’s exit from the DA, Ntuli has made it clear that his ideas still live-on. “I don’t think that disagreements, or seeing things differently, is a bad thing," Ntuli said. "The idea of diversity as part of our principles is the one that should be cherished the most, as the DA. I want to move our party into a place where everybody feels that they equal ability to ay where they believe the DA should be going and how we should be talking to voters on the ground.” READ: Mazzone not in favour of Ntuli's proposal Steenhuisen took over from Maimane and says he will continue steadying the ship. “I reaffirm my deep commitment to restoring discipline, including message discipline. We must stop talking only to ourselves and we must stop talking to the media about our internal party matters. From now on, every single DA member must focus only on the voters., all of them,” Steenhuisen said. Voting for the new DA leader wrapped up on Saturday afternoon and the results of the leadership election are expected on Sunday afternoon.
