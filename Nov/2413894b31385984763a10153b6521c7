Masks, gloves, sanitisers, pens, and disinfectants are costing the IEC an additional R3-million for this week’s by-elections, and the implications of spending this unbudgeted amount of money on PPE are serious.

"Some logistical items, we’d have to change the allocation factors. Some voter education programmes and communication programmes would have to be scaled down. We’ve got to do more with less.” The IEC plans to approach the national treasury. "The treasury would need to have a full understanding of the implications of the budget cuts," Mamabolo said.

The IEC says unforeseen PPE spending for the by-elections will break its budget, but it believes there is enough to keep all voters safe. Over 40 parties will contest 95 wards across the country, in the biggest set of by-elections of its kind in South Africa's history.
