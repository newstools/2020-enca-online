A community safety initiative has moved 60 matrics from Hanover Park to a facility in the southern suburbs where they can study safely for their final exams. “With the recent violence within the Hanover Park area, we decided to include the schools that are affected," said programme coordinator Lynzy Beneke. "Twenty learners per school [were] elected to come here and have a safe place to study.” Pupils at the facility say they all have one goal: To pass their finals. “Everyone is like focused on what they want, and their goals they want to achieve in life," said Keanan Slinger. "For me personally I didn’t think it was going to work.”
The department says all the pupils will be accommodated at the facility until they finish writing exams. * eNCA’s Nobesuthu Hejana reports.
