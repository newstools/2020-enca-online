Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Vincenzo Pietropaolo murdered his father and seven months later, used the same gun to kill his estranged wife. That's the finding of the High Court in Johannesburg. The former treasurer of the Bank of Athens initially denied murdering his wife, Manuela. Later, he admitted to the crime but blamed the victim.

The police arrested Pietropaolo on the same night of his wife's murder. Pietropaolo previously made some confessions, saying he had arrived at the house of his estranged wife to drop off documents and he encountered an “emotional storm” which provoked him to open fire. He said he had no intention of harming her but was provoked. The judge found that the murder was premeditated. "I hope you rot in hell," Manuela's sister Serena Nicolaides said during her emotional testimony. Sentencing is scheduled for Tuesday.
