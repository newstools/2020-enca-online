Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - One of the country's youngest authors is using her life experience because of her illness to assist other children to cope with life in lockdown. At just eight years old, Laena-Mae Turner from Ekurhuleni is testament to strength and resilience.
Turner was just a few days old when doctors diagnosed her with a life-threatening autoimmune disease known as hypogammaglobulinemia. She hasn't seen or been near children since the beginning of the year as a safety precaution.
Her book is a snapshot of COVID-19 through the eyes of a child.
"I wanted to show my friends that children around the world are sad as well," she said.
Turner has penned many books since the age of five. She's the youngest child globally to write and publish a book on the coronavirus pandemic.
This little girl says the book is a reminder to all children that not being able to play with friends and stay home is only for a short while. By doing so, they're helping the world beat the coronavirus. * Slindelo Masikane reports. Watch the video above.
