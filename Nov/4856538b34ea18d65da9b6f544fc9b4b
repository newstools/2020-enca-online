In "tier two" areas, the limit will be 2,000 outdoors or half the capacity, it said. In the highest "tier three" regions where Covid-19 remains acute, no spectators will be allowed. The cap for indoor events in tier one and two regions will be fixed at 1,000, the government said, as it set out a post-lockdown plan also covering business conferences, theatres and concert halls.
