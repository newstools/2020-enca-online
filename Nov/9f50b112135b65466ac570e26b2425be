"Chair, there are repeated allegations that I behave inappropriately and should be recused, that the investigators act in a biased and unprincipled manner," Hofmeyr said. "Last week, the secretariat of the commission was told by Ms Mbanjwa that it acts with bad faith. It is a litany of attacks on this commission, its secretariat, its investigators and its legal team, and there comes a point, I submit, Chair where it actually needs to be put to bed."
