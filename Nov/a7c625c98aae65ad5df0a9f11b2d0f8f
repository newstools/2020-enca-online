The past two years have been pretty long for Precious Mazibuko. In 2018, she noticed live and exposed cables connected to her meter box. She suspected it came from the informal settlement just meters from her house. City Power confirmed the box had been tampered with but months later, nothing was done. eNCA’s Heidi Giokos finds out more.

That is even though she has documents proving she alerted City Power in 2018, that residents of a nearby informal settlement, are illegally connected to her meter box.

When I told them that my bill has gone sky high, they requested that I must sign the acknowledgement of debt," she said. "So I said according to my understanding I am accepting this bill, which I never, it's just the two of us in the house. I have never used so much electricity." Mazibuko says she should not have to pay for power she doesn’t have. “I refuse to pay for the amount I didn’t use…Prior to the illegal connection, I had a bill, that I had paid, I have been paying every month. I want City Power to reduce the amount and my billing must be affordable for me,” she said.

Meanwhile, City Power says it is investigating the matter.
