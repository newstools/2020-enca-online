This is despite Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s previous record as a strong opponent of apartheid. READ: Trump says he will go to Supreme Court to dispute election count Mantashe doesn’t think his party should have loyalties to Biden. “Among the few countries that didn’t impose sanctions on apartheid South Africa was Britain and the US, irrespective of who was in power," Mantashe said. "Let’s say we condemn a particular candidate, and that candidate wins the elections. "We are the governing party in South Africa. We will be forced to work with that party that candidate who wins the elections. That’s why it is important for us not to put the cart before the horse as a government.”
