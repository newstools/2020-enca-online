Ramaphosa said South Africans need to unite in order to deal with challenges depressing the country during a deadly global pandemic.
He said, "we are going through challenging times as our nation. This is the most challenging time for the South African nation and for the African National Congress as well. This is a time that calls for all of us to work together." "We've got economic challenges, we've got social challenges and we've got our own organisational challenges within our organization. And this is the time now when all of us need to work together." Ramaphosa said the country's resources should be directed at fighting poverty, inequality, unemployment and addressing economic growth but corruption is derailing all these efforts. "This is the time, comrades when we rebuild our country from the ashes of State Capture." The president urged NUM members, leaders and South Africans in general to emulate the selfless values espoused by James Motlatsi and the late Elijah Barayi.
