Courtesy of #DStv403 NDWEDWE - Five people have died in a house fire in Ndwedwe in KwaZulu Natal on Sunday. Residents in the area called emergency services after they heard people screaming for help from inside the house. The cause of the fire is still unclear. Emergency services reportedly were hampered from entering the residence to extinguish the blaze by the security features of the home. Reaction Unit South Africa's Devan Perumal said, "when we entered the house we found it completely engulfed in flames. Huge flames coming out through the windows, doors, through the roof. Members of the public frantically ran to us and told us that there are people trapped in the house." Four children and one adult died in the fire. The victims were reportedly from the same family. Reaction Unit paramedics treated two bystanders, said to be the mother and grandmother of the victims, for shock.
