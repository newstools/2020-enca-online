The ANC has mandated members implicated in corruption to step aside, it is not a voluntary decision according to one National Executive Council member. NEC member Mondli Gungubele said the notion that this is voluntary, is misleading. He spoke to JJ Tabane on Power To Truth on Sunday evening. JOHANNESBURG  The ANC’s resolution calling on members implicated in corruption to step aside is clear. That’s according to ANC NEC member Mondli Gungubele. He says the notion that this must be done voluntarily is misleading. EXCLUSIVE: Magashule says he is not corrupt "I don't know this notion that we need a legal interpretation of the resolution. This resolution is very obvious," Gungubele said. "This country is not going to take us seriously if we don't deal with this individualism that undermines the state of the people. We are coming from COVID, which has damaged people's livelihoods. "The president is spending every day trying to implement a recovery plan. An ANC that tolerates what happened in front of the courts in Mangaung must be careful about the future of itself in this country. "If we are self-respecting, we cannot go and look for interpretation of resolutions that are very clear." * Gungubele spoke to JJ Tabane on Power To Truth on Sunday evening. Watch the interview above.
