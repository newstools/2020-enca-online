General views during the 94th Comrades Marathon on June 09, 2019 in Durban, South Africa DURBAN - The Comrades Marathon Association says it will suspend runners found to have been cheating in the 2019 edition of the race.
The CMA has announced the suspension of three unnamed athletes who took part in last year's race. The athletes were found to have either supplied false entry information and/or having used another athlete to run their qualifying race. The CMA has declared the athletes' 2019 result null and void and will impose a twoÂ to five-year ban, depending on the transgression. The Association says the athletes are tarnishing the reputation of the sport, as well as disrespecting other runners.
