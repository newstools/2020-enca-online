File: Former president Jacob Zuma. AFP/Pool JOHANNESBURG - Former President Jacob Zuma plans to bring into question the constitutionality of the establishment of the State Capture Commission of Inquiry. Zuma has filed a 100 pages long affidavit in his bid to force  Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo to recuse himself as chairperson of the inquiry. He says while this is not the basis for which he seeks the recusal, it does, however, give proper context to his reservations about the constitutionality, as well as the legality and appropriateness of having READ: Zuma's application to have Zondo recused set for Monday Zondo presides over the Commission. Zuma's affidavit also goes into what he believes is a compromising personal history between himself and Zondo. The application will be heard by the State Capture Inquiry on Monday.
