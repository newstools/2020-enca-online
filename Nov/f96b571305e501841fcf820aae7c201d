Courtesy of #DStv403 PIETERMARITZBURG - KZN Co-operative Governance MEC Sipho Hlomuka is clamping down on corrupt officials in the Msunduzi Municipality. His department recently tabled a forensic report, dating back to 2016, implicating top officials in a R290-million electricity tender scandal. Former mayor Chris Ndlela and former municipal manager Mxolisi Nkosi are among those implicated in the report.
It recommends disciplinary action and that corruption cases be opened with the police.
Hlomuka said that the report is before the city council where the recommendations can be implemented. READ: Pietermaritzburg has new mayor Hlomuka said, "some of the officials have already been suspended and disciplinary processes have already started. Let's allow that process to unfold itself, but we are monitoring that process to ensure that there's good governance and consequence management, we want to see it happening."
Msunduzi mayor, Mzimkhulu Thebolla said steps are being taken to recover the money lost. Thebolla said, "we just received the report about a month ago, we are taking necessary steps to recover those monies." "One of the ways is to ensure that we report that criminal activity to the SAPS for prosecution. We are working on suspending the staff members that are implicated in that one but remember we presume that people are innocent until otherwise." No timeframe has been set for punishing those found guilty but Thebolla said with the report now tabled in council, they have only 21 days to decide whether to follow its recommendations.
