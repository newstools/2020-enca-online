AFP/Alex Edelman WASHINGTON - Joe Biden's election as US president sparked a scramble for champagne in the capital Washington and some stores were already close to running out of stock in the Democratic stronghold. It seemed many were ready to toast an end to a tumultuous four years under President Donald Trump. Calvert and Woodley, known for its selection of wines from around the world, sold up to 75 percent more bottles than a usual Saturday, according to store employees. Store salesman Mark, who did not provide his last name, said hundreds of bottles had been sold. "People want to celebrate," he said.

Dressed in a Biden-Harris t-shirt and with a Biden-Harris sign in her hand, Juanita was one of the many customers in search of the bubbly. "I'm so happy. It's an amazing day for democracy," she said while choosing a bottle. At Magruder's, a wine shop in the residential district of Chevy Chase in business since 1845, the shelves were emptied quickly and employees had to fetch reserve cases of champagne. "People buy two or three bottles. It's very unusual," said a cashier. "People are so happy today."
