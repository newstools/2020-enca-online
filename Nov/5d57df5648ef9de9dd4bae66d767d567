Does it exist? Or is it a figment of someone's imagination? No one seems to know where to find the mysterious Cape Town Minstrel Museum. The National Lotteries Commission gave 13-million rand to the project and insists it's been up and running for the past seven years. But it's address remains unknown. eNCA’s Ronald Masinda goes searching. Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Does it exist or is it a figment of someone's imagination? No one seems to know where to find the mysterious Cape Town Minstrel Museum. The National Lottery Commission insists it donated millions to build the Carnival Heritage Museum and insists it's been up and running for the past seven years. Many in the Cape Minstrel community are still dumbfounded as to its location. Sulayman Nash has been attending the Tweede Nuwe Jaar festival for nearly 40 years. He says the legacy of the Kaapse Klopse deserves to be honoured with a museum * eNCA's Ronald Masinda reports. Watch the video above.
