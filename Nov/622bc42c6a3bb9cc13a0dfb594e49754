More than six million people in South Africa are unemployed and many young adults won't be able to find work any time soon. A few years ago, some school leavers were presented with an opportunity to attend a technical school. They are now on their way to qualifying as diesel mechanics, spray painters and auto electricians. Ayesha Ishmail reports.

They are now on their way to qualifying as diesel mechanics, spray painters and auto electricians. Most of these interns come from areas where opportunities are few and far between. Many did not qualify to study at tertiary institutions and most simply could not afford it.

Their practical training is done at Golden Arrow Bus Services and it includes a monthly stipend and free bus ticket. Once the students complete their internships and their trade tests, they will be qualified to work in the broader mechanical industry and also start their own businesses. * eNCA's Ayesha Ishmail reports.
