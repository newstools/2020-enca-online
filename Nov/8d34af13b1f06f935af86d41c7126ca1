Courtesy of #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Widespread corruption and maladministration worth billions in the Water and Sanitation Department have been laid bare in Parliament on Tuesday. So widespread are claims of corruption in the department, that the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) is now working on a motivation to President Cyril Ramaphosa to allow it to probe more projects. The department has paid a total of R8.9-million to officials who do business with the department.

The SIU recommended R40-million be recovered from officials involved in fraud and corruption at the department. The unit said officials are getting off scot-free as its recommendations are largely ignored.

Most disciplinary matters are closed after officials are allowed to make representations to the water department without informing SIU so it can provide evidence to rebut. In the Giyani water project, the price for a borehole and a water treatment plant was between R1.2-million and R1.4-million. The normal price for such boreholes is R100,000 and a maximum of R295,000 for a water treatment plant. The plant only worked for a month.
