AFP/Mohd Rasfan KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysian state energy giant Petronas set a target of "net zero" carbon emissions by 2050, the latest major oil company to step up efforts to combat climate change. The firm, a significant contributor to Malaysian government revenues, said it would aim to slash emissions by steps such as improving the energy efficiency of its operations and focusing more on renewables.
