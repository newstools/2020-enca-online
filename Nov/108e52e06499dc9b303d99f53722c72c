Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - A Cape Town business owner fears for his life after speaking out against extortionists. The owner of the Beerhouse chain, who is currently overseas, says he was warned not to return to South Africa. This, after making public the intimidation and threats businesses in the city are dealing with. In 2015, Randolf Jorberg learnt the hard way what happens when you decline certain underworld figures' offers of security. READ: Police officer accused of extortion, murder Since Level 2 of the lockdown, racketeers who used to target bars and clubs in Long Street have expanded their business to coffee shops, property developers, and many more outside the city. They charge around R20,000 protection money a month. Jorberg, who went to visit family in Germany, started a WhatsApp group and demanded that government intervene. The next day his mobile phone was traced by Zane Kilian, the man arrested in connection with top cop Charl Kinnear’s murder. READ: Zane Killian not certified as a private investigator "I started receiving death threats via WhatsApp basically warning me not to return," Jorberg said. Exactly two months ago, Police Minister, Bheki Cele promised to set up a steering committee to deal with large-scale racketeering in Cape Town but to date, nothing has come of that. Jorberg doesn’t feel safe to return to South Africa until arrests have been made. eNCA's Nadine Theron reports.
