More beds and doctors will be made available to assist with the outbreak in the province. READ: Health Minister concerned by rising cases in Eastern, Western Cape "All the time when people say the beds are full, they don't necessarily mean there are no beds, they just mean in the triaging area, you will get blocked there because people are sitting there and lying there for two days and therefore anyone who comes in can't be admitted," Mkhize said. The minister says that the cluster outbreaks in the province need to be curbed.
