 Tokyo's Natsumi Clinic specialises in restoring much-loved stuffed toys to their original glory, delighting owners like Yui Kato, who brought in her sheep, Yuki-chan. TOKYO -Â At a Tokyo clinic, a woman in a white coat carefully records the particulars of the newest patient: a sheep-shaped stuffed toy. The Natsumi Clinic specialises in restoring much-loved teddies and other cuddly toys to their original glory, delighting deeply attached owners. The clinic offers treatments ranging from "eye surgery" and hair transplants to stitching up injuries, explained founder Natsumi Hakozaki. She began treating stuffed toys four years ago in her hometown, northern Sendai city, after working at a clothes alteration shop where customers often asked if she could repair their treasured toys. "Customers saw stuffed toys as family members, partners or best friends, not mere objects. After their stuffed toys were fixed, many of them hugged (the toys), or burst into tears," Hakozaki said. The experience inspired her to open a shop offering specialised treatment, and every animal is prescribed its own course. The clinic carefully documents each stage of the treatment, posting images online so owners can keep tabs. Hakozaki is conscious of how attached people can become to their stuffed animals, and considers it key to treat the toys as if they were alive. Clients have sent toys from Hong Kong, Taiwan, France and Britain for treatment, and customers have had to wait up to a year for a spot. Repairs take about 10 days, and the clinic's website features pictures of recovered "patients" photographed together at "a party to celebrate being discharged". Hakozaki understands the feelings owners have towards their toys. "We don't just replace a father because he got sick. It's the same thing" for stuffed toys, she said, describing the attachment as something "universal". "There are people who consider their stuffed toys as family members not only in Japan but also around the world."
