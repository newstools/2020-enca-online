Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute has come with a new preventative measure, that’s 90-percent effective. Initial results from clinical trials show taking an injection of PrEP and CAB LA, once every eight weeks, is more effective than taking a daily pill to prevent HIV among women.

"The company that makes cabotegravir has not allocated a cost yet. But what they have articulated is the importance of access, particularly in low- and middle-income countries in the region where HIV is more prevalent," said Sinead Delany-Moretlwe However, researchers, are also warning that making the drug available should not be rushed. "We are not looking at something that is going to be available immediately but this is going to be fast track, both from the clinical research point of view and the manufacturing side," said Helen Rees from the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute. "Access to this in a country like ours, with such high numbers every year, it could be a game-changer. But we will have to have a little bit of patience for some months."
