With the initiation season looming, traditional leaders say to avoid the mushrooming of illegal schools government must reconsider its decision. READ: Initiation schools set to resume in December "Those who are going to be allowed, let them cooperate with government in terms of social distancing, masks and so on," said Contralesa President, Kgosi Mathupa Mokoena. "And we are saying, it can’t be business as usual. If I used to have a hundred initiates, this time even if I get forty or less, it’s fine because this is the culture it’s not a money-making machine." Traditional leaders met with Police Minister Bheki Cele in Johannesburg on Friday to discuss their request. Cele says government will be able tackle illegal initiation schools. READ: Contralesa warns of repercussions if initiation schools stay closed "We’ll have to pounce and we’ll have to arrest whoever is doing anything that is out of the law and you will remember that COGTA has come with the law on this, anyone who breaks that law, especially that leads to the death and the loss of human life, police will have to act on that,” he said. He has also urged traditional leaders to fight gender-based violence and femicide while protecting victims of the scourge.
