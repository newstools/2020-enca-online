The police's National Crime Combatting Forum (NCCF) met in Pretoria on Saturday to discuss the crime, following a robbery at a Fidelity depot, earlier that day. Also, there was two attempted cash in transit (CIT) robberies in Soweto on Monday. READ: Explosive CIT robberies increasing again It is understood that crime intelligence is being criticised for not thwarting these attacks. It's also believed that the suspects are known to authorities. The NCCF has agreed to re-activate a Crime Intelligence Unit established last year, to specifically, deal with cash van robberies. Former Hawks head Johan Booysen has described the situation as a national crisis.

They acquire stolen vehicles, explosives, jammer equipment. The organisation is elaborate. I can't see how it is possible that our intelligence services can't get to the bottom of this, infiltrate these syndicates and expose them." Among the concerns is the extreme violence of the attacks, which often leaves the police outmanned and outgunned. Police declined to comment on the NCCF meeting, saying it relates to operational matters.
