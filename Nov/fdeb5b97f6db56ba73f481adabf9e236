AFP/Punit Paranjpe NEW DELHI -Â Coach Ravi Shastri believes India's pace attack can conquer Australia "in their own den" in the upcoming Test series between the world's top two sides. India's quick bowlers, led by Jasprit Bumrah, will face a powerful home batting line-up including David Warner and Steve Smith when the four-Test series begins on December 17. But Shastri said his team's pace unit was the best in the world, despite being likely to be without the injured Ishant Sharma who is receiving treatment India for a muscle tear.

Shastri dubbed Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Siraj, Umesh Yadav and Navdeep Saini the "fabulous five", adding, "Yadav has the experience. Saini is young and fast. Bumrah one of the best in business. Shami is raring to go. Siraj is an exciting prospect. "You put up runs on the board and watch these fast bowlers hunt the opposition. They can beat Australia in their own den." Australia last week overtook India at the top of the inaugural world Test championship when the scoring system was amended due to the coronavirus pandemic, but Virat Kohli's men enjoyed a historic first Test series win Down Under on their last tour in 2018-19. Shastri is confident his team can stay focused on and off the pitch during the tour, which requires travel bubbles and isolation because of the pandemic.
