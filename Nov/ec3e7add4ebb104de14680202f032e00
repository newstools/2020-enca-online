File: Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. ANA/Karen Sandison JOHANNESBURG - Former SAA board member Yakhe Kwinana is once again giving the state capture inquiry a tough time on Tuesday. Inquiry chairperson Justice Raymond Zondo lost patience with Kwinana for not answering questions thoroughly enough. WATCH: State capture inquiry hears more SAA-related testimony When Kwinana refused to comment on the question, "how could SAA not could have been involved and/or party in an agreement that sought to set aside 30 percent for another entity that was not yet established?", Zondo said, "your response doesn't speak well of you as a witness". Zondo also expressed concern by the insults she directed at Former SAA Chief Procurement Officer, Masimba Dahwa.
