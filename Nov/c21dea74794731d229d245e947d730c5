File: Dr. Bandile Masuku. @bandilemasuku\@GautengHealth\twitter JOHANNESBURG - Former Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku's efforts to have the SIU report that led to his axing reviewed and set aside, is gaining momentum. A full bench of the High Court will hear the matter on 21 January. Masuku was relieved of his duties after a report found he failed to execute his functions in compliance with the Constitution and the Public Finance Management Act. This was related to the procurement of personal protective equipment. Masuku is also considering legal action against the ANC as he's yet to receive a charge sheet from the ANC's Provincial Disciplinary Committee.
