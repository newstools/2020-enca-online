The commission had previously made an order to protect the identity of the witness. Commission chairperson, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo says what Myeni did undermines the work of the commission in a very serious way. "What you did would discourage other witnesses who want to give evidence before the commission anonymously when they fear for their safety or their lives, something that is very crucial to the work of the information," Zondo said. "They are, I believe many people who would like to share information with the commission and would have been wanting to do so over the past two and a half years. But who simply feel that they will be victimized, in terms of work, in terms of business, and in terms of their careers and they are not coming forward and then there are those who really fear for their safety, their lives and the safety of their family members yet who have crucial information that is important for the work of the commission. "Now if something like this happens and happens right in the commission, it undermines the work of the commission in a very serious way."
