Many drivers refused to speak on camera, fearing for their lives. eNCA reporter, Lindokuhle Xulu spoke to a driver who agreed to an interview if his identity was protected. He said the attacks are more than just a labour issue. He says the reason foreign drivers get jobs is that local drivers refuse assignments in the SADC region. He says they only want to drive locally and be with their families, while foreign drivers are more prepared to make sacrifices.

One of them said to avoid being attacked, they're often required to prove their nationality.
On the other side, one South African driver, returning from Zimbabwe, said he fears for his life when he's out of the country.
While he condemns the acts of violence, he said the reason behind them is because of a failed labour system that favours the highest bidders.
An appointed ministerial task team is set to table its intervention plan soon. *Watch the full interview above
