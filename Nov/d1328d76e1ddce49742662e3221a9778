Starting next year, the tax rate will rise from 13 percent to 15 percent on incomes over five million rubles (R1 million). Putin made the announcement in a televised address in late June, a week before the country was due to vote on controversial amendments to the constitution that paved the way for the president to potentially stay in power until 2036.

The current flat tax system was introduced in 2001 and was among the key reforms of Putin's first presidential term. Modifications to the tax system have been discussed for several years, including the possibility of tax cuts for lower incomes.

But with the "new quality of administration, the introduction of digital technologies, it has become possible to distribute the tax burden in a more differentiated way," he added.
