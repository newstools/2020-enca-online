Some parents and pupils have told eNCA that discrimination based on skin colour is part of the school's culture. "They tell us we always want to see colour when everything here at school is about colour. If you're black, you get certain things and you don't get certain things and if you're white you get most of the stuff because this is your area, apparently," one parent said. Some parents say otherwise. READ: Brackenfell SGB: Claims of racism are not new The department said schools that have recently become integrated are more vulnerable to racial tensions.
Spokesman Steve Mabona said, "we have admitted that pockets of racism or behaviour that are not acceptable you're prone to see because it's a system that you are changing, it's people that you are changing, and it's people, its human beings. I mean if someone was taught a certain way it becomes difficult for you to change them in a day."
Seven pupils have been suspended for the brawl.
Investigations are ongoing and a report into the matter is expected to be handed to the department by Friday.
