"My first encounter with aviation was I actually got to go to SAA during high school and met pilots and saw the planes up close," she said. "Just getting that whole experience made me fall in love with aviation. And from that day onwards when I walked away from SAA this is definitely where I see myself."

"With SAA it's really sad because I have always wanted to start my airline pilot career there," Katisi said. "Aviation will pick up, as one of my mentors says. People aren't going to America by ship, they will still want to fly."
Katisi invests a lot of her time in educating and mentoring young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. She wants to show them that dreaming big is never a bad thing. * eNCA's Heidi Giokos has more. Watch the video above.
