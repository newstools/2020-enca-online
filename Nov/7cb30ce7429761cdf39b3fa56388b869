Dukwana served under Magashule until he was fired. He claims that was because he had refused to sign a letter given to him by Tony Gupta, after Magashule took him to the Guptas' home in 2011. EXCLUSIVE: Magashule says he is not corrupt Dukwana says he's prepared to answer to any criminal charges directed at him as a result of an investigation. Magashule appeared in the Bloemfontein Magistrate's Court on Friday facing 21 charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering linked to the Free State's asbestos saga. The ANC secretary-general is out on bail of R200,000.
