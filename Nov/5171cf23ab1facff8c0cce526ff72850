Donald Trump has refused to accept his loss, despite his opponent getting over six million more votes. AFP/Mandel Ngan SAUDI ARABIA - US President Donald Trump went golfing after making a brief online appearance at the G20 summit Saturday, an event hosted by Saudi Arabia but staged virtually because of Covid-19. Trump, who has still not accepted defeat following President-elect Joe Biden's victory in November 3 presidential polls, spoke following the opening of the two-day virtual summit.

It was an exercise in "self-publicity" said the source, adding that "he didn't say anything about the global situation". "It's been an honour working with you and I look forward to working with you in the future and for a long time," he said according to a second participant. After his moment in the virtual limelight, Trump was substituted by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as the other world leaders had their say. Later, he left the White House and headed to his golf course in Virginia, not far from Washington.

Another sign, however, showed a slice of bread marked with the words: "Face it. You're Toast."
