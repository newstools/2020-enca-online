He said, "in principle, we agreed that the truck operators must with immediate effect prioritise the employment of South African drivers." "We will soon, together with <the> national government, mount an intensive operation along the N2, N3 and N11 routes in KwaZulu-Natal targeting drivers without proper permits." "Every foreign national who is currently driving a South African-registered truck must be appropriately licenced, and hold a valid permit issued by the Department of Home Affairs." "The Department of Home Affairs work permit is only issued upon offer of employment by the prospective employer in South Africa. In the meantime, the truck operators have committed to providing at least 400 new jobs, and these will prioritise South Africans."
