Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Another Western Cape child has been murdered - allegedly by a parolee and on the same day that eight-year-old Tazne van Wyk was buried, after a convicted murderer was arrested in connection with her death. Reagan Gertse was the same age as Tazne. He went missing in Tulbagh after he was seen walking with a family member, who'd recently been released from prison. According to sources he was raped before he was murdered. READ: Tazne van Wyk's suspected killer absconded from parole Gertse was last seen on Saturday morning walking with the 53-year old man. An 11-year-old friend of Reagan's identified the man on Sunday morning, shortly before Reagan's body was found by his father. The man seen with Reagan was recently released from prison and was staying with Reagan’s father, Ricardo Davids’s parents, three doors down. The man is expected to appear in the magistrate’s court in Tulbagh this week. Reagan is one of at least five children in the Western Cape murdered this year already.
