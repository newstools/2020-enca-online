This is the 49th edition of the race, which is over 56km, and comes close to both the Indian and Atlantic oceans, hence it's name. JOHANNESBURG - The 2020 Two Oceans Marathon has been cancelled amid the coronavirus pandemic. The race was scheduled for 8 - 11 April. Following an emergency meeting, board members unanimously decided to cancel the marathon. “We have been monitoring the status of the novel coronavirus pandemic as events have unfolded internationally and locally and we’ve consulted with public health experts and authorities,” said race director Debra Barnes. Coronavirus in SA: 51 cases confirmed “The health and safety of the competitors, staff, sponsors and the global community are paramount and an event of this scale poses far too great a risk to continue,” Barnes added. South Africa has 51 confirmed cases so far.
