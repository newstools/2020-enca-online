Zimbabwe also wants targeted sanctions to be removed as they hinder economic growth. In addition to the massive food insecurity, inflation in Zimbabwe is high, there are fuel shortages and intermittent outbreaks of diseases like cholera. Musabayana says the country's socio-economic challenges are huge. “That situation is not good for development it’s not the business of government to buy fuel and we are forced to chirp in because other companies aren’t willing to sell fuel in Zimbabwe because they are not getting lines of credit abroad and in Zimbabwe, you have to pay cash upfront,” Musabayana said. READ: Zimbabwe's economic meltdown It's not possible to refer to Zimbabwe’s many challenges without touching on land reform but Musabayana says they want to move on. “We are saying let bygones be bygones the land issue is now the constitutional issue and let us bury the hatchet and we want Zimbabwe to be accepted back in the global economy," the minister said. Some Zimbabwean nationals are sceptical about the government’s position. “I don’t think them talking about reforms can change anything, we need political leadership change and we have political crisis and legitimacy is the cause of the crisis in Zimbabwe,” said Oscar Madanhi from the MDC. Zimbabwean authorities say they will continue to galvanise more support to end sanctions and are reaching out to Western nations.
