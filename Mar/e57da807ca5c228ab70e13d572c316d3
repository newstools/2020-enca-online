 JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng government has started testing residents of Stjwetla in Alexandra for COVID-19. A resident in the township tested positive for the virus and now the Department of Health is trying to trace everyone who has come into contact with him. Stjwetla, like many other parts of Alexandra, would be fertile ground for the coronavirus as contact with others is almost unavoidable.

Premier David Makhura says those who test positive will have to go into quarantine at a different location. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
