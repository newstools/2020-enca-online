Eurovision is the latest in a series of high-profile cultural and sporting events to be cancelled because of coronavirus. THE HAGUE - The 2020 Eurovision Song Contest scheduled for May in Rotterdam has been cancelled for the first time in the event's 64-year history due to the coronavirus outbreak, organisers said. Broadcasters were now in talks with the Dutch port city for it to host the event -- a glitzy pageant of songs that has millions of viewers across Europe and further afield -- in 2021, they said. "It is with deep regret that we have to announce the cancellation of the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 in Rotterdam," the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said in a statement.

"However, the uncertainty created by the spread of COVID-19 throughout Europe -- and the restrictions put in place by the governments of the participating broadcasters and the Dutch authorities -- means the EBU has taken the difficult decision that it is impossible to continue with the live event as planned." Eurovision is the latest in a series of high-profile cultural and sporting events to be cancelled because of coronavirus, including the Euro 2020 football championships and Britain's Glastonbury music festival.
