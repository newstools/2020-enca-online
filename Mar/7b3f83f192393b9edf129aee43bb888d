Taxi bosses blame government for violence as there's not enough regulation of the industry. JOHANNESBURG - Strict regulations and a special police force are just some of the suggestions Santaco’s Johannes Mkhonza has made before the commission of inquiry into taxi violence. Mkhonza has put the blame on the government and says solving the problem of violence will require strong state intervention. The witness stand at the commission is a true hot seat. On Tuesday, the inquiry was adjourned over safety concerns as taxi owner widows were set to testify.

According to Mkhonza, this is a reality for him and many in the industry and recalls some instances when his life was in danger. "I was shot with a AK-47 as I was driving out of the rank so I survived that," he said. "In 2003 I was shot at the gate of my house when I was coming from the office."

The commission resumes on Thursday.
