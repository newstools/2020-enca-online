CAPE TOWN - Southern Sun and Sun International founder and business tycoon Sol Kerzner (84) has died after a long battle with cancer on Saturday. Kerzner died at his home at Leeukoppie Estate in Cape Town surrounded by family. His family said at his own request, and in light of the global health crisis, the funeral will be kept private and small with only immediate family in attendance. Kerzner family spokesperson, Ian Douglas remembered the man on eNCA as a maverick and described him as "someone people will always look up to". Douglas said Kerzner was a private person who had extraordinary vision and was able to believe in big things whilst not neglecting details. He said Kerzner didn't believe in shortcuts, had a great sense of humour and was a good friend. Douglas said he had a temper and was not afraid to confront others but was "one of those guys who you always knew where you stand with him". A public memorial will be held but is yet to be arranged, according to the family.
