 CAPE TOWN - An old age home in Paarl has literally woken up and smelt the roses on the first day of lockdown thanks to a generous flower farm. It's donated around 600 flowers which would have been used for weddings, to the home. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, these celebrations have either been cancelled or postponed. So the farm outside Cape Town is paying it forward. A group of florists have joined forces with the farm to create an amazing floral display. While the flowers have wilted slightly, they are still a somewhat cheerful sight on an otherwise sombre street.
