That's the promise from Mineral Resources and Energy Minister, Gwede Mantashe. He says Eskom won't run out of coal to generate electricity, because coal mines will continue producing coal, albeit on a smaller scale.

Eskom said in a statement that the possibility that load-shedding may be implemented, remains. "As an essential and critical services supplier, some of Eskom’s personnel are exempt from the provisions of the lockdown," the power utility said. "As such, we do not expect any impediments to the generation and supply of electricity during this period.

Eskom urged the public to continue to use electricity sparingly and to assist the utility in reducing demand.
