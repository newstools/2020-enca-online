HARARE - Zimbabwe confirmed the second case of COVID-19 infection on Saturday. The second patient is a 30-year-old man who lives in Harare and travelled to New York from 29 February to 9 March. The man developed mild symptoms of the virus on 12 March and was directed by his doctor to self-isolate at home. After a week of worsening symptoms, the man developed severe respiratory distress and is currently receiving treatment at Wilkins Hospital in Harare. WATCH: Ban on foreign visitors from high-risk countries The Zimbabwean government is tracing all the people the man has had contact with after his return. The Zimbabwean government on Tuesday announced a raft of steps to prevent the virus from spreading -- including the cancellation of public and sporting events, and constraints on gatherings. Schools will close on Tuesday.

It came under further strain last year when hundreds of junior doctors at state hospitals staged a three-month strike over conditions and pay, which then was less than $200 a month.
