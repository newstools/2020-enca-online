The 35-year-old rapper said he was unaware that Lady Zamar had laid a charge until police contacted him in December regarding the incident. "I met with two police officers from the Thohoyandou police station. They asked about the night (in September 2017) that Lady Zamar accuses me fo raping her and asked for a statement. "I gave my statement. They also got statements from some witnesses who were with us going to, during and coming back from that trip," continued the statement. On Tuesday, organisers of the Cape Town International Jazz Festival announced that Sjava will no longer be part of the line-up for the popular event.
