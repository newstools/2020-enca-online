The party is also proposing some general economic relief, including a freeze on the rates bill for businesses. “For the economic survival of businesses and families, we propose a nationwide payment holiday on loans, in particular, property loans, business loans, and vehicle loans by extending the term of these loans by four months, and allowing borrowers to pause their payments for those months. Business and families will receive immediate release,” said DA finance spokesperson, Geordin Hill-Lewis. Opposition parties will be meeting with President Cyril Ramaphosa at Tuynhuys on Wednesday to discuss the crisis presented by COVID-19.
