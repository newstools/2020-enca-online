Last week, Gauteng Premier David Makhura announced that the capital city would be placed under administration due to a collapse in service delivery and a dysfunctional council. The last three council sittings have collapsed after walkouts by the ANC and the EFF but the DA has refused to accept Makhura's decision. READ: ANC wants unity government in Tshwane The DA has accused Gauteng Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) MEC Lebogang Maile of not following due process in terms of the constitution and that he continues to mislead the public while creating confusion within the administration. The DA has also accused Maile of abusing his powers by defying the democratic will of the people and that the conditions to allow him to intervene do not exist in Tshwane.
