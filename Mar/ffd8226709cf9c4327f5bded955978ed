The world's biggest stars are fighting the boredom of the coronavirus quarantine. BERLIN -¬†They're used to full social calendars, the gaze of adoring fans and being surrounded by crowds -- but in these days of corona lockdown, celebrities are shut indoors just like the rest of us. Here's a look at how the world's biggest stars are fighting the boredom. - Boateng's toilet roll kicks - Bundesliga¬†footballer Jerome Boateng has started a trend by doing kick-ups with a toilet roll -- an item that has become a symbol of the coronavirus crisis in many countries thanks to shortages caused by stockpiling. In a video on Instagram, the Bayern Munich defender manages an impressive 20 kicks before the makeshift football finally tumbles to the floor. Elsewhere, England footballer James Milner shared a tongue-in-cheek film of himself rationing tea bags, setting them out into neat piles on his kitchen table, and preparing to cut his lawn by measuring the grass with a ruler. Should be listening to the CL anthem these days, instead juggling some toilet paper rolls üßª okay, challenge accepted ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ I NOMINATE @da_27 @leroysane19 @princeboateng @chilliams23 @kingarturo23oficial @jamesrodriguez10 A post shared by  J√©r√¥me Boateng (@jeromeboateng) on Mar 17, 2020 at 11:26am PDT - The Terminator feeds his mini pony - Former California governor and "Terminator" actor Arnold Schwarzenegger set Twitter alight with a video urging people to stay home and listen to the experts, while casually feeding carrots to his mini poney Whiskey and donkey Lulu from his kitchen table. ‚Ä™Stay at home as much as possible.
