Schools and universities are closed and employees of most companies have to work from home. Non-essential travel abroad is prohibited until 5 April all gatherings are banned and police are patrolling the streets to monitor and enforce the restrictions. WATCH: Raising COVID-19 awareness Asked how long this would last, De Block said, "that's the million-dollar question! We are now heading towards the peak of the epidemic, after which the curve will descend. I think this situation will last for at least another eight weeks. It would be the normal curve." She said the estimate was based on what happened in China and South Korea, where the epidemic hit earlier.
