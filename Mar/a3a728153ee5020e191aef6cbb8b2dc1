Resources in the Western Cape are especially strained. Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Gender-based violence is increasing in South Africa and the list of victims grows daily. Resources in the Western Cape are especially strained. Organisations like Childline say they are battling to provide assistance. With only 10 Childline social workers in the Western Cape, the organisation says, it’s barely managing to provide assistance. This means abused victims are often placed on waiting lists. “Sometimes they could wait anywhere from one month to three and half months and of cause that is not ideal,” said Western Cape Childline Director Ricky Fransman. “We are very aware when someone experiences a trauma, the longer they sit with the trauma the more difficult for them to recover from it.” READ: EFF MPs leave Sona debate after gender violence accusations While cases are escalating, Childline says its hands are tied. “More people are reporting it, so obviously that has had an impact on the number of referrals that have come through on us,” Fransman said. “We haven’t been able to increase the number of social workers to keep up with demand for our services.” Childline says while the social development department assists them with funding, unfortunately it’s not enough. In response, the department says requests for funding are assessed and then considered within its available budget, as it also funds other NPOs.
