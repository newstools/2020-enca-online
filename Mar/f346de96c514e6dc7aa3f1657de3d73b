The Congress of Traditional Leaders of SA says people in rural areas will be worst affected if the virus spreads. Contralesa says as the coronavirus pandemic continues, greater emphasis should be placed on rural areas. READ: Rise in COVID-19 cases is a concern: Mkhize “We need to have one hymn sheet for the country. That hymn sheet must be translated in all languages. It must reach all SAs asap,” said Contralesa general-secretary, Zolani Mkiva. The organisation says rural and poor communities will be severely affected if the virus spreads to those areas. Contralesa is calling for a fresh approach. “In between all the programmes, 12 hours per day, there must be something about this. This thing can easily wipe out big numbers from our communities if we don’t take drastic measures,” Mkiva added. Contralesa and the government are to meet in the coming days to ensure knowledge of the virus reaches all parts of the country. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
