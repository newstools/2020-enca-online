LONDON - Wimbledon organisers are still planning to play the Grand Slam this year, despite the coronavirus chaos that led the French Open to be pushed back until September. Wimbledon is scheduled to run from June 29 to July 12, but All England Club chiefs are aware the sporting schedule has been decimated by the deadly pandemic. French Open bosses revealed the clay-court event will move from its scheduled spring slot to September.

A roof has been installed over Roland Garros' centre court, Philippe Chatrier, with floodlights on the three other main courts, enabling play to go on later. Wimbledon remain hopeful that play at the grass-court tournament will be able to go ahead if the spread of the virus is slowed. But Richard Lewis, chief executive of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, insisted they would put public safety first.
