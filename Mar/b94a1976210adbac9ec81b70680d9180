In the Western Cape, there have been 32 suspected cases, none of which turned out to be the coronavirus. A suspected case will be someone who’s presenting flu-like symptoms like a cough and a fever, who has had contact with potential carriers or recently travelled to countries where the virus has been transmitted. Thermal scanning as a monitoring tool at Cape Town International Airport is one of the measures in place. A provincial joint operations command centre has also been set up to manage communication about the disease between different departments.
