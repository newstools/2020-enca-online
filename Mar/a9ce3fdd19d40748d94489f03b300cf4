The South African Medical Association says it has been receiving complaints about a lack of protective gear for doctors. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said the government can't provide private institution workers with safety gear. National Chairperson of the association Angelique Coetzee has condemned this, saying it could contribute to the outbreak spreading.

"If you see this patient looks severely ill to you, you stop the patient just where he is and you do not touch that patient. You must stay at least 2-3 meters away from that patient and immediately send that patient for tests and alert the local hospital", she added.
