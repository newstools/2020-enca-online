Morocco has confirmed 61 cases of the coronavirus and two deaths. Most of the sick caught the virus abroad, but it has now also started to transmit within Moroccan cities. RABAT - Moroccan police have arrested at least a dozen people for spreading rumours about the coronavirus, including a woman who used her YouTube channel to say the disease did not exist, authorities said on Thursday. "Fake news is the first cause of panic among citizens," said Prime Minister Saad Eddine El-Otmai, comparing the spread of misinformation with the contagion of the disease. Other people were arrested for opposing strict measures against public gathering, urging people to ignore them, or saying a lockdown had been implemented when it had not.
