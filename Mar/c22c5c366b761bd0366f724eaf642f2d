First Lady Melania Trump addresses the 2020 National Parent Teacher Association (PTA) Legislative Conference at the Westin Alexandria Old Town on March 10, 2020 in Alexandria, Virginia. JOHANNESBURG - First lady Melania Trump will urge Americans to wash their hands and keep their distance from one another to fight coronavirus in a new TV ad campaign produced with major US broadcast networks, the White House said on Wednesday. ABC, CBS, NBC, and other networks will air the public service announcements, which will also include other Trump administration officials and "communicate the most important ways Americans can protect themselves and those most at risk," the White House said in a statement. Nickelodeon will create a separate campaign for children. READ: Trump tests negative for virus as US expands Europe travel ban The air time will be donated by media networks, the White House said. Trump, a former fashion model, has avoided the public arena more than many first ladies. Her signature initiative has been a campaign called Be Best, which focuses on the safety and well-being of children. All the ads will direct audiences to coronavirus.gov, a website containing the latest information about the outbreak. The announcement comes as the US death toll from COVID-19 rose to at least 146, with the number of infections closing in on 8,000 as millions of Americans stayed home instead of going to work or school and President Donald Trump said hospital ships would be deployed to make up for an anticipated shortage of hospital beds.
