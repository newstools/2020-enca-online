JOHANNESBURG - To those who overcome adversity and stay the course to reach their goals - whether it’s Olympic glory or something closer to home - Bridgestone wants to help you chase your dream, no matter what. South Africa is a nation of resilient individuals who have big dreams. The success of the Springboks at the 2019 Rugby World Cup and Zozibini Tunzi's crowning as Miss Universe shows we can accomplish anything we put our minds to. Bridgestone is launching an inspirational campaign on Wednesday in South Africa ahead of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo entitled Chase Your Dream, No Matter What. The aim of the campaign is to inspire South Africans of all ages, abilities and passions to chase their dreams and overcome the obstacles they face on life’s journey.
