 JOHANNESBURG - Government have lambasted the Mail & Guardian newspaper for their report stating that there are no SANDF crew willing to take the journey to repatriate the South Africans trapped in Wuhan. The newspaper is quoted as saying that a senior official intimately familiar with the discussions has revealed that defence force personnel are unwilling to man the aircraft. READ: South Africans living in China afraid to return home GCIS Acting Director-General Phumla Williams said the article is misleading and misinforms readers and the public about government's handling of the repatriation of South Africans from China. "The article casts aspersions on the work of government on the repatriation process... by an unnamed source," said Williams. "The discourse in the article about SANDF officials is also deceptive, as all hands are on deck to ensure a smooth repatriation process of our people."

South Africa will evacuate 151 citizens from Wuhan within days. The group will be kept in quarantine for 21 days at a site authorities have refused to disclose.
