 JOHANNESBURG - Eskom will continue to implement load-shedding until further notice. The power utility is struggling with maintenance backlogs at its power plants. Eskom disconnected one of the units at Koeberg on Tuesday because of a fault with the plant's turbine system. READ: Stage 4 load-shedding to continue until Friday The nuclear reactor remained safe, it said. "The faulty pump at Koeberg has now been repaired and is running again," Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha said. Mantshantsha said by the end of Sunday, the unit will be generating again and that will help ease load-shedding. LOAD-SHEDDING: Schedules, info, and how it affects you The utility said in a statement it is in the process of obtaining regulatory approval in order to synchronise the generating unit back to service by Sunday. It however warned that cuts may continue into the weekend as the system was constrained, unpredictable and vulnerable. "We've gotten back three generation units, today we are getting a few more back," said Mantshantsha. "By tomorrow [we've communicated and said Stage 4 load-shedding will carry on until Friday], we will scale down to lower stages of load-shedding if not completely do away with it by the weekend." - Additional reporting Reuters
