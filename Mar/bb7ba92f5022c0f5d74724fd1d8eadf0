Mashaba says he is targetting individuals based on their level of commitment to the people of South Africa. Democratic Alliance's Johannesburg caucus chairperson Funzela Ngobeni has announced his resignation from the DA. Ngobeni, a former MMC for Finance in the City of Johannesburg, is set to join Mashaba's People's Dialogue party. He was the DA's mayoral candidate to replace Mashaba when he resigned from his position late last year.

"I believe we will have more people coming from the ANC than any other party joining us in the coming days, weeks and months," Mashaba said. "I am not looking at people from political parties to join us, I am looking at committed South Africans who are prepared to serve society. "So we are not going to be chasing people because they are coming from political parties. We are going to chase them on the basis of their commitment to serve society."
