Two men leave a "bottle shop" displaying a sign showing dozens of beers for sale in Melbourne. SYDNEY - Hard-drinking Australians were told to limit themselves to buying just 12 bottles of wine and two cases of beer a day as a coronavirus lockdown saw panic buying of alcohol. Major retailers agreed to enforce new rules limiting individual purchases as Australians went on a booze-buying spree amid a shutdown of non-essential services -- including pubs and bars. "It was clear that uncertainty on the impact of supply... caused some people to purchase differently," Retail Drinks chief executive Julie Ryan said in a statement launching the restrictions. "We want to now send a clear message bottle shops remain an essential service and there are no issues of supply."

The restrictions come as data from the Commonwealth Bank -- one of the country's biggest financial institutions -- showed spending on alcohol at bottle shops jumped 86 percent last week as drinkers migrated from bars to backyards. "These temporary measures will ensure that all consumers can continue to access their favourite drinks when they decide to make a purchase," Ryan said.
