At this year’s tournament, the team finally showed the form that had eluded them for some time. READ: Australia beat Proteas Women to make T20 World Cup final The Proteas Women matched their best performance at a T20 World Cup, topping the group before their defeat in the last four. But after a third World Cup semi-finals exit, the team has been left wanting more. Captain Dane van Niekerk says the semi-finals is not enough. “The group of players we have, we’re not happy with the semi-finals. The World Cup would have been satisfying. We did incredible things, but we spoke about it after the 2017 World Cup, where it was just not enough”. The performance has reinforced the belief that a World Cup is within reach.

Coach Hilton Moreeng says, “What is going to be important is two things – to make sure that we keep our youngsters’ on the ground, keep working on them to keep pushing for places within the first eleven, that will make sure that the senior players, they keep performing.” The Proteas surprise win over England and the narrow rain-adjusted loss to Australia would suggest a full-strength South African outfit can be competitive against the very best. The focus now shifts to the series against Australia starting later this month, with planning for next year’s fifty-over World Cup also in mind.
