JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Education Department says it will be engaging authorities from Grayston Preparatory School on its decision to close the school on Monday due to COVID-19 fears. The department says no school has the authority to make such a decision without seeking guidance from them. A teacher from the school is said to have had contact with a group of South Africans that had recently travelled to Italy.
