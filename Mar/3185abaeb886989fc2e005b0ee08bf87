 JOHANNESBURG - Would you call in to complain about your boss paying you below the minimum wage? Well, the employment and labour department has launched a toll-free hotline where employees can report their employers anonymously. The national minimum wage is currently R20.76 an hour. READ: Minimum wage defaulters to be named and shamed Designed for vulnerable and isolated workers, the Impimpa Hotline allows for reporting non-compliant employers. And it costs employees nothing. "This is not a declaration of war on employers," said Thulas Nxesi, Employment and Labour Minister. READ: Minimum wage comes into effect "Without employers, we don't have jobs but we do insist on certain basic standards to ensure the dignity, safety and conditions of service of their workers."
Once a complaint has been lodged, an inspector will pay your employer a visit with 14 days. If your employer is found to be paying you below the minimum wage, they can either make an undertaking or be referred to the CCMA for an order. The Labour Department has flagged a shortage of inspectors but says the hotline will ensure cases are resolved speedily.
