Therefore the Neuroscience Institute serves as one of the first institutions that have been set up that can address local issues that affect brain health,” said Rachael Dangarembizi, UCT lecturer in Neurophysiology. The centre was conceived in 2015, and it's expected to be fully operational in May. “The idea is to get academic activities going and bring in people from a range of backgrounds, not only from the medical school and the health science faculty, but also from other campuses,” said professor Graham Fieggen, UCT Neuroscience Director. The facility won't only be treating patients. It will provide invaluable training to UCT medical students.
