File: Pearl Jam'sÂ new album "Gigaton" is scheduled for release on 27 March. NEW YORK - American rock band Pearl Jam announced they are postponing the first leg of their North American tour this spring over coronavirus concerns. "Unfortunately, communing in large groups is a huge part of what we do as a band and the tour we've been busy planning for months is now in jeopardy... We have and will always keep the safety and well-being of our supporters as top priority," frontman Eddie Vedder said in a statement on social media. "So it is with deep frustration and regret that we are forced to make this most unfortunate of announcements... This scheduled first leg of our PJ/Gigaton tour will need to be postponed and shows rescheduled for a later date." The band's new album "Gigaton" is scheduled for release on 27 March. They had planned to embark on a 16-date North American tour in March and April, with destinations including New York's Madison Square Garden. "We've worked hard with all our management and business associates to find other solutions or options but the levels of risk to our audience and their communities is simply too high for our comfort level," the statement signed by Vedder and the band said. "Add to that we also have a unique group of passionate fans who travel far and wide. We've always been humbled by this and respect their energies and devotion. However in this case, travel is something to avoid."
