US Jarrion Lawson competes in the Men's long jump event during the IAAF Diamond League Anniversary Games athletics meeting at the London Stadium in London on July 22, 2018. WASHINGTON -Â The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Monday annulled the four-year ban imposed on Jarrion Lawson by the sport's governing body World Athletics, following an appeal by the American long jumper and sprinter. Lawson, who was suspended last year after testing positive for the banned substance epitrenbolone, had denied wrongdoing, saying the substance could have entered his body through the consumption of tainted beef in June 2018.

"Following a careful review and examination of the evidence and expert testimony... the panel was unanimously of the view that Lawson had established that he bore no fault or negligence for his positive finding. As a consequence of such finding, the period of ineligibility was eliminated."
