Mbalula said cars certified to carry four people will now only be allowed to carry one, while eight-seaters will be permitted three occupants. Taxi owners will benefit from a repayment holiday to help lighten the burden of loans owed on their minibus taxis. This is one of the measures government is taking to lighten the burden for the informal taxi industry. Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula says the army will help ensure those within and outside South Africa adhere to the shutdown. Members of the army will be deployed from Thursday evening to help the police enforce the shutdown and ensure security is upheld.
