Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour said March 16, 2020 New York's Met Gala would be postponed over the coronavirus pandemic. NEW YORK - Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour said New York's Met Gala would be postponed over the coronavirus pandemic, as she rebuked President Donald Trump's handling of the crisis and threw her weight behind his Democratic rival Joe Biden. "Due to the unavoidable and responsible decision by the Metropolitan Museum to close its doors, 'About Time,' and the opening night gala, will be postponed to a later date," the head of the fashion magazine's American edition said in a post on Vogue's website. This year's edition of the sartorially-focused exhibition is to explore "About Time: Fashion and Duration," and was as usual set to open with a star-studded bash the first Monday in May.

"Like everyone else, I have been experiencing this COVID-19 crisis as a series of hurtling developments, where one never knows quite what each new day will bring," Wintour wrote, before roundly admonishing Trump. "I, like so many of us, have been appalled by how he has responded to the pandemic -- the optimistic and fact-free assurances that all will be fine, the chaotic implementation of travel bans and claims about a 'foreign virus,' the narcissistic ease with which he has passed blame to others, his dishonesty with the American people, and worst of all, his shocking lack of empathy and compassion for those who are suffering and fearful," she said.
