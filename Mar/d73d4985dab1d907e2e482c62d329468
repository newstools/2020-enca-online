CAPE TOWN - Cosatu is expected to present its proposals for an Eskom Social Compact to the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises. Cosatu wants government workers and private pension funds to bail out Eskom. The labour federation also says the Public Investment Corporation could fork out R250-billion to save the ailing power utility but this, in turn, could mean taxpayers will have to be liable for another troubled state-owned entity. The state-owned entity currently has a debt to the tune of R450-billion.
