Jawad Javed and his wife Asiyah put together coronavirus protection kits to be delivered the vulnerable people of their community of Stenhousemuir. FALKIRK - A grocery store owner and her husband are handing out parcels of hand sanitiser and face masks to the sick and elderly in central Scotland to help protect them against the coronavirus. Asiyah Javed started the project after meeting an old woman who was upset that she had been unable to buy hand soap at her local supermarket because shelves had been emptied. "I decided then to do something for the elderly," Javed from Stenhousemuir, near Falkirk, told AFP. "I came back to the store and packed some hand wash and hand sanitiser and face masks into wee bags and posted on Facebook, saying there would free delivery for the elderly and infirmed customers." Javed and her husband Jawad got to work and were soon packing and delivering parcels to every home they could find in the area with an elderly person living in it.

"When we arrive with the parcels, they give us a hug and they are very happy -- they say 'thank you'. They are really happy we are doing it for them." At the corner shop, customers trickle in and out, many leaving with the items they can't live without -- soap, chocolate, milk, toilet paper and cigarettes. Javed says getting through hard times is simple. "We need to work together. If we work as a community, we will all be fine," she says.
