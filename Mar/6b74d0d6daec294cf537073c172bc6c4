JOHANNESBURG - South Africa has closed the majority of its border posts following an increase in infections in the country. SUMMARY: Ramaphosa announces COVID-19 controls There’s concern over the Golela Border Post staying open during South Africa’s National State of Disaster. It serves as a gateway between South African and eSwatini, which has so far reported only one Coronavirus case. International cruise passengers could also be stuck in limbo when vessels attempt to dock at South African ports as those on board an Italian vessel at Cape Town Harbour. While the port is open, it's affected by President Cyril Ramaphosa's announcement of a travel ban for a number of high-risk countries. Ian Stewart, a freelance tour operator, said, “the industry has been severely affected due to the cancellations. We rely on the cruise ships make a living. This is not good for us.” Port authorities are taking no chances. MAP: SA border post closures As soon as the Italian vessel, Aidia Mira, was berthed, she was placed under quarantine. The ship was carrying 1,730 passengers. Port health authorities were seen entering the ship and escorting six passengers off. The passengers had apparently been in contact with a person who tested positive for the coronavirus before they boarded. The group of six will now be tested, while the rest of the ship's passengers and crew will have to remain on board in isolation until the results are known. This could take between 24 and 48 hours. Many have missed their flights out of Cape Town to return to Europe.
