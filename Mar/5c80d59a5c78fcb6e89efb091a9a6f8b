Going to jail is their only option, but they say at least they’ll be safe and have access to water and toilets. Police are concerned about women and children.

"We are asking the pastor and the church to think of these vulnerable kids and women who are here,” said refugees spokesperson, Alide Bukuru. Bukuru is appealing to international human rights agencies for assistance. “We as refugees, there is nowhere we can run we are powerless in this country so let us run to the UNHCR because they have a mandate to protect refugees.”
