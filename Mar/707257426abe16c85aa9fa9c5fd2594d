File: Eskom disconnected one of the units at Koeberg on Tuesday because of a fault with the plant's turbine system. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom is reducing load-shedding from stage 2 to stage 1 from 12 pm on Saturday. Earlier, Eskom dropped load-shedding from Stage 3 to Stage 2. The embattled power utility says it's due to a drop in demand and an improving generation system. READ: Load-shedding for the weekend Eskom implemented stage 4 load-shedding this week after its Koeberg Unit tripped. It has since been brought back online. South Africans are urged to continue using electricity sparingly.
