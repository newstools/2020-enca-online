"We have looked at the clip and I have been informed that our Gauteng office will look into this issue to see whether there has been a violation of dignity. Whether the people were coerced or compelled to attend the session and how they feel and then we will take it from there", said SAHRC CEO Tseliso Thipanyane.

While many people thought the video was funny, others thought that black adults were being disrespected. Thipanyane said it is important for people to know that they can approach the commission and lodge a complaint if they believe that their rights have been violated.
