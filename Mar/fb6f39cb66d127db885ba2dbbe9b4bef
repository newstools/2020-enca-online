Refugees and asylum-seekers in Cape Town have been sleeping on the street since Sunday. They say they have nowhere to go. Last month, the High Court in Cape Town ordered refugees to comply with municipal by-laws. The city approached the court after the refugees refused to leave the Central Methodist Church and surrounding areas. The City is expected to head back to the Western Cape Division of the High Court for clarity.
