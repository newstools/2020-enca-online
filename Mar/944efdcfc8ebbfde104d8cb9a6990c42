The start of the 2020 academic year has not been a smooth one for several institutions and students across the country. Learning has had to take the backseat as campuses were affected by protests resulting in clashes with police and security. Students say they're not getting the free education they were promised. Courtesy #DStv403 EMPANGENI - Students have been ordered to vacate university property at UniZulu's Kwadlezwa Campus in the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal. Varsity management decided to suspend all academic activities following violent student protests. Students are complaining -- among other things -- about safety and transportation of students living off-campus. Students also want NSFAS to pay for their transportation. “Issues that we have raised they’re very genuine because it also talks about the issue of safety and security," said Mxolisi Khanyile, a student leader. READ: Academic activities at TUT to resume on Wednesday University management says it never received any formal communication from aggrieved students. “As management we have not even been presented formally with any document or any request for a meeting to discuss students grievances so technically we are really dealing with ghost protesters,” said UniZulu professor Mashupye Kgaphola. "If you remember last year we did went to street fighting for our safety and security but nothing has been done.” The campus remains closed and it's unclear when classes will resume.
