Prince Harry and Meghan Markle received a standing ovation as they took their seats at an evening of military band music at London's Royal Albert Hall on Saturday. LONDON - Prince Harry and his wife Meghan will make their last official appearance as senior royals on Monday, joining Queen Elizabeth II for an event in London before they set off on their own. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will join other members of the royal family at a Commonwealth Day ceremony at Westminster Abbey. It is their final public engagement before they step back from their roles at the end of March, no longer representing the queen and pursuing a new, financially independent life based in Canada. READ: Prince Harry, Meghan attend first engagement since royal exit announcement Harry and Meghan rocked the monarchy with their bombshell announcement in January that they wanted to break free from the constraints of royalty. They complained about media intrusion, a long-running issue for Harry, who watched how photographers pursued his mother Diana until her death in a Paris car crash in 1997. Their decision to leave prompted anger and dismay among many royal fans in Britain, but both Harry and Meghan received a warm welcome in their final flurry of engagements.

And Meghan drew shrieks of delight from school children in Dagenham, east of London, when she made an unannounced visit on Friday. In a visit to mark International Women's Day, Meghan paid tribute to the women whose strike at the nearby Ford Motor Plant in 1968 helped pave the way for the 1970 Equal Pay Act. "No matter what colour you are, no matter what gender you are, you have a voice and you certainly have the right to speak up for what is right," she told the children.
