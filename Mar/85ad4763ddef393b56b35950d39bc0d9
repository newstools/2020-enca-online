"I think couples should already have those conversations, in that there is going to be conflict. We are going to get on each other's nerves and irritate each other so expect, discuss it and put some steps in place to manage it best. Routine is very important if we try and stick to the same routine every day, it gives us a sense of normality and that we have control over our lives", she added.
