JOHANNESBURG - Former Bosasa employee-turned whistleblower, Angelo Agrizzi apologised to a Correctional Services official he claimed received bribes from the company. Agrizzi returned to the State Capture Inquiry on Friday. READ: Mokonyane itching to cross-examine Agrizzi at Zondo Commission In January 2019, Agrizzi claimed Jabu Sishuba received bribes, that was paid out by the late Bosasa CEO, Gavin Watson. Agrizzi then retracted the statement and then apologised, but Sishuba said she wanted the apology made at the Inquiry. Agrizzi said it was a confusing time when he made the initial claim. The former Bosasa employee has previously given bombshell testimony on the alleged corruption between Bosasa and some government officials. He told the commission of irregular tender deals between the company and the department of correctional services. Agrizzi also alleged that then Minister Nomvula Mokonyane had received bribes from the company. READ: Bosasa paid for Sona after-parties, says Agrizzi He has also implicated himself. The most implicated person was Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson, who died in a car crash last year.
