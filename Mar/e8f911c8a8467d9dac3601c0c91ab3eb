I was completely blown away by everything that this project stands for, everything that it's achieving. Each R1,000 basically buys a new little violin and for every new little violin that we have we can invite another child to Muzukids and any child who is a Muzukids just has a different set of possibilities in their lives," said Bruwer. Muzukids is based in Cape Town and provides daily lessons for Grade R pupils in the area. Bruwer has managed to raise R35,000 to help the non-profit organisation.
