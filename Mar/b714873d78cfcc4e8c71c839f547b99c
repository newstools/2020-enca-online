A shortage of ibuprofen on the shelves at a Sainsbury's supermarket in Cambridge, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson announces the government's coronavirus action plan. GENEVA - The World Health Organization recommended that people suffering COVID-19 symptoms avoid taking ibuprofen after French officials warned that anti-inflammatory drugs could worsen the effects of the virus. The warning by French Health Minister Olivier Veran followed a recent study in The Lancet medical journal that hypothesised that an enzyme boosted by anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen could facilitate and worsen COVID-19 infections.
