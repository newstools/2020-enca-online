Cape Town Cycle Tour men's race winner Travis Barrett. JOHANNESBURG - Cherise Willeit won her fifth Cape Town Cycle Tour title in Cape Town on Sunday. Travis Barrett took first place in the men’s race. Willeit finished the 78km women’s elite route in 2 hours, 7 minutes, 48 seconds. She said after the race, “every win at the Cycle Tour is special but this was a tough one. My legs were cramping during the sprint. It was a long sprint into a headwind and I must have kicked five times in the final 500m." According to organisers Willeit has won the second most titles among the women at the Cape Town Cycle Tour. Anriette Schoeman has won the event seven times and finished in the chasing bunch. Barrett on the other hand beat former winner Clint Hendricks (Enza) by the width of a tyre to finish in 2:30.04 for the 109km. “It was a very long sprint and I could sense Clint coming up beside me. But I held on.” Barrett said. “I still can’t believe it. Winning the Cycle Tour is what every rider dreams of.” The organisers believe Barrett is rapidly becoming one of South Africa’s brightest young stars. Results Men (109km) Women (78km)
