JOHANNESBURG - The future of the Tshwane Metro hangs in the balance. The National Council of Provinces is yet to pronounce on whether it will support a decision by the Gauteng government to dissolve the council and place the metro under administration. It received representations, from concerned parties, over the past two days. READ: Tshwane placed under administration Gauteng Premier David Makhura decided to invoke section 139 of the constitution two weeks ago, following the collapse of several council meetings. Last week Co-operative Governance Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma backed the decision. Tshwane has been without a mayor and municipal manager after several failed attempts by the DA to elect a new mayor. This as the ANC and EFF staged walk-outs and boycotted council sittings. The DA is challenging the decision in court next week.
