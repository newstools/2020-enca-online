Joe Marchant scores a try during the Super Rugby union match between Stormers and Blues. CAPE TOWN - The perfect Super Rugby record of the Western Stormers this season ended on Saturday with England wing Joe Marchant scoring two tries for the Auckland Blues in a 33-14 triumph. Having won four consecutive matches and boasting six victories in their last eight matches against the New Zealanders, the South Africans were expected to succeed in Cape Town. But a table-topping Stormers side that seemed to believe they needed only turn up to win struggled for possession and territory from start to finish and ended a well-beaten team. The sole consolation for the Cape Town outfit is they remain top of the combined standings with 17 points, three more than defending champions the Canterbury Crusaders of New Zealand. A key moment at Newlands stadium came in an additional first-half time when Marchant scored his second try to help the Blues lead 27-14 by the break. Awarded a penalty in their 22, the Stormers kicked to touch but lost the subsequent line-out by overthrowing the ball and the Blues launched an offensive. Wing Mark Telea, barely back on the field after being sin-binned for a dangerous tackle, eluded several tackles and the ball moved wide for Marchant to score in the corner. Fly-half Otere Black, who contributed 18 points, converted and the Blues had a comfortable lead again after seeing a 20-point advantage reduced to just six. Only six points were scored in the second half with Black slotting two penalties for the eighth-place Blues against a Stormers team that barely threatened to cut the deficit. TV analyst and former Springboks coach Nick Mallett labelled the Stormers "schoolboys" after an error-strewn performance that included missing 36 tackles and conceding 11 penalties. Marchant was more diplomatic after receiving the man of the match award, saying the Blues had met "good teams" in South Africa, referring to the Northern Bulls and the Stormers.
