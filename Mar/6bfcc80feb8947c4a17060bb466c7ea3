The British Boxing Board of Control said that Billy Joe Saunders' licence would be suspended until a hearing could be arranged. LONDON - WBO super middleweight champion Billy Joe Saunders had his licence suspended by Britain's boxing authorities on Monday after a social media post in which he advised men how to hit their female partners during the coronavirus lockdown. The British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) said in a statement that Saunders' licence would be suspended until a hearing could be arranged under its misconduct regulations. Saunders had filmed himself punching a bag in a barn and advising "dads, husbands and men with girlfriends" how to deal with their female partners during the coronavirus lockdown.

Saunders apologised for the video on social media over the weekend and again on British radio station TalkSPORT on Monday, where he also pledged to donate 25,000 pounds ($31,000) to domestic abuse charities. "I just want to say sorry again for everyone I've offended," he said on TalkSPORT.

Saunders was scheduled to face Mexican Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in a super middleweight unification bout on May 2 in Las Vegas before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
