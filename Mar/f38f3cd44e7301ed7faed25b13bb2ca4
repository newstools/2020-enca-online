File: Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune has made his return to the national team. JOHANNESBURG - Long-serving Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune has made a return to the national team after a two-year hiatus. The Kaizer Chiefs shot-stopper has been included in the 25 men squad to do duty against Sao Tome in back to back Afcon 2021 qualifiers later this month. Khune last played for the national team in 2018 due to injuries. The injuries caused him to miss the Afcon tournament held in Egypt last year. “I’m fully aware that Khune hasn’t played, in our meeting with coach Ernst Middendorp, I made him aware that we might select Itumeleng Khune. We had a very interesting discussion about Khune and he ended up saying to me Khune and Daniel Akpeyi are the number 1’s at Kaizer Chiefs." "The difference is that Daniel is currently doing well and by the way Daniel has also got a call up to be in the national team of Nigeria, so playing Khune with his qualities and experience is also a player to be considered for the national team,” Bafana Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki said.
