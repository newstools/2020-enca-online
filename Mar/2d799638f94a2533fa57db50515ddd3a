The timing is terrible because so many people are working from home during the lockdown. "We live vicariously, unfortunately, through these undersea cables and they are cables in the middle of the ocean, well at the bottom of the ocean, kind of at the edge of a continent. SA Lockdown: Mthembu sends his gratitude to South Africans staying at home Sometimes things happen, waves or big sea currents can do something to affect the cables. There are many ways that these cables can break", said tech expert Toby Shapshak. He said the cable should be repaired soon. "Hopefully this time will not be as bad as last time because this time it's only one break in the cable and apparently it is somewhere in the UK and somewhere in Portugal. But at least that is closer for a ship to get to fix", he added. South Africa has begun a 21-day national lockdown in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
