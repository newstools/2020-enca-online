Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula held a media briefing to give an update on the implementation of COVID-19 regulations in the civil aviation sector. A number of flights were grounded at OR Tambo International Airports on Friday. Foreign visitors on arriving flight were prevented from disembarking. The move is part of new measures to curb the spread of Covid-19. As more people self-isolate, shopping centres are seeing fewer customers. This is the result of strict new rules regarding crowd numbers and alcohol sales.
