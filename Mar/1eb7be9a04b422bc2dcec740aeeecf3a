The pin was pulled at the last minute on the opening Grand Prix of the year in Australia as concerns spiked following a McLaren staff member testing positive. MELBOURNE - F1 boss Chase Carey insisted it was too soon to say whether other races will be cancelled this season over rising coronavirus fears as McLaren said 15 team members were now in quarantine. The pin was pulled at the last minute on the opening Grand Prix of the year in Australia as concerns spiked following a McLaren staff member testing positive. It saw the team withdraw from the Melbourne race and McLaren said another 14 personnel were now in quarantine at the team hotel for two weeks, in accordance with local health authority directives. They were all in close contact with the person who tested positive. "Any other team members who show symptoms will be tested immediately and self-isolate, in line with our protocol," McLaren said.

Carey refused to be drawn on whether Bahrain and the third Grand Prix in Hanoi would also be called off, insisting it was too early to say given the fluidity of the situation. The fourth race in China has already been postponed, with Holland scheduled to run after Vietnam. "Right now, here, we are addressing the issues in Australia. We will in the coming days be looking at races that are more imminent like Bahrain and Vietnam," Carey said in Melbourne. "And we will have further announcements and decisions on how we navigate the short-term elements of our schedule. We know there are issues there."
