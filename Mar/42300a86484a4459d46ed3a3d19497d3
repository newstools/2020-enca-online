 BARBERTON - An uneasy calm has returned to a town in Mpumalanga, rocked by weeks of protests for basic services. Barberton, a World Heritage Site, certainly doesn’t look it. The roads are riddled with potholes, the grass is long, infrastructure isn't maintained, and water is scarce. The community blames a 2016 decision to merge Umjindi Local Municipality with Mbombela. READ: Barberton residents plead for service delivery In February, the community’s patience with poor services from Mbombela Local Municipality ran out, and not for the first time. Media reports from the time quote Mbombela’s spokesperson Joseph Ngala as saying the amalgamation will be positive for both communities and that services will be delivered. Some four years on, and the community of Barberton wants a divorce.
