Andile Hltashwayo from the protest organisers, Ubumbano Lokuthula, says that the mayor has acknowledged the corruption that is going on the municipality. "A meeting was held where Mr. Madlala confessed that his name is implicated in many activities such as criminal activities and he further also acknowledged the corruption that is going on in the municipality and in that regard we, therefore, call on that he must resign in with immediate effect," Hlatshwayo said.
