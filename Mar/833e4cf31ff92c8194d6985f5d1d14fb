Twice-married Johnson, 55 -- who split from his wife of 26 years in 2018 -- has been publicly dating 31-year-old Symonds since early last year. The British leader, who took office last summer and then swept to an emphatic victory in the country's December general election, will be the first UK prime minister to wed while in office for 250 years. He and Symonds have already made history as the first unmarried couple to occupy the prime minister's official residence.
