PRETORIA - President Cyril Ramaphosa is calling on all South Africans to observe two-minutes of prayer or silent meditation. The national day of prayer will be held on the eve of the 21-day national lockdown. Ramaphosa says the prayer should be held between 18:00 and 18:30 on Thursday. “These are challenging times. We are traversing a path we have never travelled before," Ramaphosa said. "There are many amongst us who are fearful, uncertain and vulnerable. I call on our people to offer a prayer and a thought for the protection and healing of our land and its people from this disease." “Over the past two weeks, South Africans from all walks of life have demonstrated their resilience by complying with the restrictions that have been placed on their lives. Because we are in a state of national lockdown our prayers must be offered from our hearts and in our homes,” President Ramaphosa said.
