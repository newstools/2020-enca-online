 KATHMANDU - China and Nepal have cancelled permits for Mount Everest because of the coronavirus, expedition organisers said. Last year's traffic-clogged spring window saw a record 885 people summit Everest, 644 of them from Nepal and 241 from the northern flank in Tibet. Nepal has suspended climbing on all mountains in the country and stopped issuing tourist visas, Yogesh Bhattarai, Minister for Culture Tourism and Civil Aviation told AFP. "The government has decided to suspend all spring expeditions and scrap permits for the time being. The decision can be reviewed after analysing the global scenario over the coming month," Bhattarai said. Tourist areas in Tibet have been closed since January, according to the local tourism office. READ: Why a deadly shadow hangs over Everest summit The China Tibet Mountaineering Association, which issues permits for Everest, declined to comment when contacted by AFP. Another company, Alpenglow Expeditions, has cancelled its Everest plans. "I am in agreement with China's decision. It is responsible... Climbing a mountain is not currently worth the transmission risk in the Base Camps, nor upon returning home," Adrian Ballinger of Alpenglow Expeditions said in a statement Wednesday. Some companies in Nepal have also seen cancellations. "We had bookings from 23 climbers, but two groups have already cancelled. We might have just 8 to 10 climbers this year," said Pasang Tenje Sherpa of Pioneer Adventure. Everest attracts hundreds of mountaineers from all over the world each spring, when a window of good weather opens up between late April and the end of May, prompting a rush for the summit.
