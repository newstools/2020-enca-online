File: Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has lost yet another court case TSHWANE - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has lost yet another court case and has been ordered by the North Gauteng High Court to personally pay 15% of the costs order. Mkhwebane will not be allowed to access former President Jacob Zuma's tax records. The North Gauteng High Court has ruled the Public Protector subpoena powers do not extend to taxpayer information. WATCH: Judgment in Mkhwebane-Ramaphosa saga Mkhwebane demanded that the South African Revenue Service (SARS)  hand over Zuma's private tax records as part of her investigation. SARS commissioner Edward Kieswetter argued in his application that the revenue service was bound by law to preserve the secrecy of taxpayer information.
