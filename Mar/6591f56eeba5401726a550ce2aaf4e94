ANC Acting Provincial Secretary Lindiwe Ntshalintshali said, “Members have died now. Two of them. We are saying to those families that it pains us. How do we face these families? A member has gone to a meeting. He doesn’t come back. ANC should be a home, should be safe for everybody, but today ANC is where we kill each other. How do you go to a meeting with a gun, with knives, and there’s stabbing?” President Cyril Ramaphosa is condemning the deaths.

We are extremely concerned that ANC members should find it so easy to quarrel among themselves up to and including the point where they unleash violence against each other including some losing their lives.” Meanwhile, the destruction in Barberton continues.
