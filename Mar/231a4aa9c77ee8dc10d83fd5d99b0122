The man accused of killing UJ student Palesa Madiba was a no-show in court. #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The family of murdered UJ Soweto campus students Palesa Madiba say they are disappointed about another delay in justice and closure. Madiba’s family and friends arrived early in court on Monday morning hoping it would be the beginning of finding out the truth. However, the Bachelor of Commerce student’s alleged killer didn’t pitch, forcing the judge to postpone the case. Dumisani Mkhwanazi allegedly buried her in a shallow grave in his mother’s backyard in Phiri, Soweto.

All that we need is justice. Whatever delaying tactics he is trying to play, the court will deal with it," said Madiba's aunt, Malesela Moshidi. “We just hope he tells the truth. That he finds it in him to be human enough to tell us the truth”. Madida was last seen in Phiri while visiting her best friend over the Women’s Day long weekend in 2013. It's her friend’s uncle who is facing trial for her murder. READ: Women from the EFF want justice for Palesa Madiba It is unclear why Mkhwanazi didn’t appear before the judge on Monday. Madiba's family was told that he didn't answer to wardens when they called his name during roll call. The family says it hopes he does not pull the same stunt again on Thursday when the trial resumes.
