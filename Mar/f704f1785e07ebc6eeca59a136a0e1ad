"In these challenging times, it is more important than ever for our sport to pull together to provide as much certainty as possible to all those affected by these postponements," said ITF president David Haggerty. "We recognise the huge impact this will have, but ultimately the health and safety of players, officials and spectators have to be our primary concern."
