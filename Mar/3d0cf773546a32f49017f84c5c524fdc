France consumes nine billion of the long loaves every year and has an annual competition for the best baguette in Paris. PARIS - As anxious consumers around the world stockpile toilet paper and pasta, the French are thronging bakeries for baguettes, fearing a shortage of their daily bread as they wait out the coronavirus epidemic in confinement. The country of 67 million people consumes nine billion of the long loaves every year, has an annual competition for the best baguette in Paris, and a special word for the pointy end they chew off on their way home from the baker after work: the crouton. Bakers are among the few essential-service businesses allowed to stay open in France under strict anti-virus confinement measures. And they are thriving, with long lines in the cities and countryside alike. "Our numbers have doubled since Monday," Addenour Koriche, sales manager of a bakery attached to a large supermarket north of Paris, told AFP this week. "We are now on 800 baguettes per day. Yesterday, for example, we had no baguettes left to sell by 3pm." The store closes five hours later. There are 33,000 bakeries in France, one to about 2,000 people on average, but most neighbourhoods boast several -- sometimes even in the same street.
