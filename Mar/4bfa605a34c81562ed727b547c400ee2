Master baker Tim Kortuem presents cakes in the shape of a roll of toilet paper at his bakery. DORTMUND, Germany - A German baker has drummed up some much-needed demand during the coronavirus crisis by making cakes in the shape of toilet rolls. Faced with a slump in sales as customers stayed away, baker Tim Kortuem got the idea when people complained about a shortage of goods in supermarkets after Germans started stockpiling. Sales of toilet rolls rose 700 percent in March from February, grocers say. "We thought, we should just create toilet rolls for eating. And that's how the idea emerged," Kortuem told Reuters Television.
