READ: Khune makes Bafana Bafana return “In France they might want to quarantine them but we are still in negotiation to find a way that they release them as soon as possible because we don’t want a situation where they are not part of the preparation. What we are going to do when they release them from the quarantine we still have them monitored very very closely. "Because we don’t want them saying they have the virus and then spreading to the other players but we can't completely remove the risk but we need the players and as far as Caf is concerned, all games are proceeding as normal because in Africa the coronavirus is not an epidemic," Bafana Bafana team doctor, Thulani Ngwenya, said. Over 48 people have died from the coronavirus in France while 24 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in South Africa.
