READ: COVID-19 pandemic easing in Western Cape Mkhize also introduced a new track and trace system. The digital health system is called Covid Connect, available on all mobile phones. "This recommendation is based on the evidence that most patients with a mild COVID-19 infection continue to share the virus from their upper airways for approximately 7 to 12 days. The detectable virus when testing doesn't necessarily imply infectiousness," said Mkhize. Mkhize says the system will continually engage with the affected user and will help zone in on possible COVID-19 contacts.
