The raid on Crave Meat came after a social media post went viral, alleging that management wasn't notifying employees about their colleagues who’d tested positive for COVID-19. Allegedly, when the matter was reported to management, it was shrugged off and it was business as usual at the butchery.

"What's important for us is that the business puts lives before profit. This site inspection is going to tell us if the business is prioritising issues of sanitizing, social distancing and issues of masks. Secondly, we'll also get into the actual labour issues that have been raised by the social media platforms," said BCM spokesperson Samkelo Ngwenya. READ: Cut down on meat?
