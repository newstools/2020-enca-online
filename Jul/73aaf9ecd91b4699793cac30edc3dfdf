Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Former Springboks coach Peter de Villiers has weighed in on the Black Lives Matter debate. De Villiers also spoke out against the surge in gender-based violence. He said men can longer use violence to solve problems. The former national coach said that no man a right and power over any woman. On Black Lives Matter, de Villiers believes that the injustices of the past still persist today. "The normal thing today is that black people are struggling because of the fact that they have been looked down at and people do not grant them any opportunities...And they have been robbed of the best they can be," said de Villiers.
