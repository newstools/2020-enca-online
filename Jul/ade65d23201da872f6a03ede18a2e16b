A researcher works on the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 in Brazil. PARIS- There is little chance of a 100 percent effective coronavirus vaccine by 2021, a French expert warned, urging people to take social distancing measures more seriously. "A vaccine is several years in development," said epidemiologist Arnaud Fontanet, a member of the team of scientists advising the government on the crisis, speaking on BFMTV television. "Of course, there is an unprecedented effort to develop a vaccine, but I would be very surprised if we had that was effective in 2021," he added.

And since another lockdown was out of the question, people had to go back to "more serious habits". "This summer, let's respect physical distance, at least!" he said, stressing that large gatherings were the main threat. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday.
