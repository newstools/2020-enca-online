BELGRADE, SERBIA- Tennis world number one Novak Djokovic, who last week tested positive for coronavirus, donated more than 40,000 euros ($45,000) to a Serbian town badly affected by the pandemic, local media reported Wednesday.

The town declared a state of emergency in late June due to the spread of the respiratory disease. READ: Djokovic tests positive for COVID-19 After restricting the first outbreak of COVID-19 in early May, Serbia is now reporting a fresh surge, logging more than 200 cases daily recently compared to around 50 a month ago. The Balkan nation was recently in the spotlight for allowing Djokovic to host a regional tournament that started in Belgrade in mid-June before a slew of COVID-19 infections forced organisers to cut it short. Apart from Djokovic three other tennis players -- Grigor Dimitrov, Borna Coric and Viktor Troicki -- who participated in the Adria tour, as well as his coach Goran Ivanisevic, tested positive. Players had embraced across the net, played basketball and even danced in a nightclub the week of the first leg played in Belgrade.
