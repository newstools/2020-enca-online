Juventus' Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo leaves the pitch at the end of the Italian Serie A football match AC Milan vs Juventus played behind closed doors on July 7, 2020 at the San Siro stadium in Milan. MILAN -Â Juventus wasted the chance to move 10 points clear at the top of Serie A as the defending champions blew a two-goal lead to lose 4-2 at a Zlatan Ibrahimovic-inspired AC Milan on Tuesday, after second-placed Lazio's shock defeat at Lecce. Maurizio Sarri's men led through goals from Adrien Rabiot and Cristiano Ronaldo early in the second half but were then blown away by a brilliant Milan display as Ibrahimovic scored and had an assist. Milan coach Stefano Pioli, who could reportedly be sacked at the end of the season, saw his side boost their hopes of European qualification by moving above Roma and Napoli into fifth.

"There have been some tough moments, but I love what I do." Juve remain on track for a ninth straight title, sitting seven points clear of Lazio with seven matches remaining, but could have rendered the race all but over with a victory. The loss snapped the Turin giants' seven-game winning run in the league.
