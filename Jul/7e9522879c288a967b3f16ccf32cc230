File: India's approval for Zydus comes days after privately held Bharat Biotech got a similar green light for human studies for its vaccine candidate. WASHINGTON - US biotech firm Moderna said it would enter the final stage of human trials for its COVID-19 vaccine on 27 July to test how well it protects people in the real world. The announcement came as the results from an earlier trial intended to prove the vaccine was safe and triggered antibody production was published. The upcoming Phase 3 trial will recruit 30,000 participants in the US, with half to receive the vaccine at 100 microgram dose levels, and the other half to receive a placebo.

Or, if they do get infected, whether the vaccine prevents symptoms from developing. If they do get symptoms, the vaccine can still be considered a success if it stops severe cases of COVID-19. The study should run until 27 October 2022, but preliminary results should be available long before.

Moderna had previously published "interim results" from the first stages of its trial, called Phase 1 in May.
