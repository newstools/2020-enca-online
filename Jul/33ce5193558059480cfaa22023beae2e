Orlando Pirates' defender Mthokozisi Dube (R) tackles Kaizer Chiefs' midfielder George Maluleke (L) during the Premier League football match between Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs at the FNB Stadium in Soweto on February 29, 2020. JOHANNESBURG- Highlands Park head coach Owen da Gama says that South African players are too comfortable playing the Premier Soccer League. Da Gama says that teams are overpaying their players. “I think South Africa is overpaying players and that makes it very difficult for them to leave. I mean you can go to Cameroon, go to Ghana, and get a player for €100,000 (R1.9-million) easy. You can’t come to South Africa and get a player for €100,000." WATCH: South Africa's quest to develop elite footballers He was speaking on why Bafana Bafana do not have many players playing abroad in the best leagues. “I think some of those players are stuck in that rut of I’m wealthy. I can afford a house for R10-million. I can afford whatever car I can want, why must I go?" he said. "Sundowns have won the Champions League so there’s a lot of quality in the country."

I think we should have at least 20-teams in South Africa and that has an effect on Bafana Bafana," he said. He says that Bafana Bafana must also perform at the highest level to attract more suitors from Europe.
