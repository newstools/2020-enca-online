READ: Zimbabwe to ease coronavirus curbs, but lockdown to remain Last week, the government suspended trade on the Zimbabwe stock exchange and stopped mobile phone-based payments to address what it calls economic sabotage.

More than 80% of all transactions in the country are conducted via phone due to a shortage of banknotes, according to central bank data. Some street vendors have now resorted to selling their goods in foreign currency.

Expectations were high that Zimbabwe's economy would finally begin growing again following the late President Robert Mugabe's departure at the end of 2017 but that hasn't happened.
