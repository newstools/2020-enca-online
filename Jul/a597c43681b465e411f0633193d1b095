Taxi association, Santaco says the battle with government is not just about the taxi industry but about protecting jobs. Labour union Cosatu threatened to go on strike if the government doesn't revoke its decision to allow taxis to operate at 100 percent capacity. The association says the threats are unfortunate.

Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG -  The South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) has criticised Cosatu for calling for the decision to allow taxis to operate at 100% capacity be reversed. The trade union federation says a full taxi load puts passengers’ lives at risk amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Cosatu is threatening to go on strike over the decision. Santaco says Cosatu is ignorant of its plight. READ: Santaco to load taxis at 100% capacity “Cosatu's remarks is a clear indication that Cosatu has been ignorant of what has been happening over a period of two months between the taxi industry and government. Contrary to what they believe that government gave in to the association's demand, the taxi industry has been equally fighting for the very same workers which Cosatu claims to represent,” said Santaco spokesperson, Thabisho Molelekwa. “We are therefore baffled by their intention to strike, on the basis of the protection of workers...” he added. READ: Cosatu threatens taxi boycott Molelekwa added that speculation over whether government gave into the taxi industry's demands was “untrue and unfounded.” “The issue around 100 percent loading capacity has been on the table between us and government for at least a month and a half, wherein principle the very same government was saying they are warming up to the idea but would only have to explore and look into various elements of the safety aspect of the 100 percent," Molelekwa said.
