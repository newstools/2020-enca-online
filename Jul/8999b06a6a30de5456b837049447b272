Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Minerals Council of South Africa has slammed claims that the mining sector has become the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. READ: COVID-19 hits North West mining industry hard The industry's made headlines in recent weeks for recording over 1,700 cases but Dr Thuthula Balfour from the council says to use the word epicentre is unfair. "I don't think we should really be using that term. Probably at the time, it was being used in terms of mining is when a lot of the mineworkers were being onboarded, they were coming back and some were being tested a lot of tests were done when they were coming back and the numbers then were rising," she said. Dr Balfour said that while a lot has been done so far in the industry to curb the spread of the virus, there still remains a lot of work to do. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
