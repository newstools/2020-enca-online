COVID-19 in SA: Calls for school closures mount There are calls for schools to be closed as the coronavirus spreads unabated, but Karim reiterates that children should remain in schools, provided proper COVID-19 regulations are adhered to. “I'm not sure right now whether there's any part of the country that I would recommend that children should not go to school. I think at this point, even though cases are rising, the actual fraction of infections is quite small and so at this stage if the rules are followed, If we make sure we have social distancing and that we follow protocols that have been recommended for schools, there should really be no concerns that children will be at great risk when going to school,” said Karim.
