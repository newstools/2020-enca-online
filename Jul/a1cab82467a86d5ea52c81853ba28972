Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG -The Fair Trade Independent Tobacco Association (Fita) has filed for leave to appeal a court ruling dismissing its bid to overturn government's ban on tobacco products. Under level 3 lockdown, the sale of cigarettes is prohibited. This after the High Court in Pretoria ruled against Fita last month. READ: Fita application to have cigarettes declared essential dismissed The court said a product's addictive properties do not mean it can be deemed essential during the lockdown. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, President Cyril Ramaphosa assured smokers that the ban on cigarettes will eventually be lifted. Ramaphosa: Ban on cigarettes will be lifted, just not now “The ban on cigarettes will be lifted. It is still in place in terms of the regulations and I think we should accept it as such and with time as we go to another and another level, the ban on cigarettes will also be lifted,” said Ramaphosa. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
