PARIS - Telecom giant Huawei reported double-digit revenue growth for the first half of the year on Monday as it appeared to have recovered from a sales slump seen after the coronavirus pandemic broke out in its home country China. The sales figures came just as the British government was poised to make a crucial decision on Huawei's involvement in the UK's future 5G telecoms network. The 454 billion yuan ($64.9-billion) first-half revenue figure -- up 13.1 percent year-on-year -- pointed to a sharp uptick in sales for the second quarter, after first-quarter revenue came in at just 182.2 billion yuan, a mere 1.4 percent increase year-on-year.

Washington has lobbied allies to shun Huawei over suspicions that its telecoms gear could contain security loopholes that allow China to spy on global communications traffic. Also reporting a net profit margin of 9.2 percent for the first half, Huawei said communications technologies were both a tool for combatting the coronavirus and an engine for recovery of the world's battered economies.

But despite the improvement in the latest figures, Huawei's sales growth of 23.2 percent was still well below that seen a year earlier.
