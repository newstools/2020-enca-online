Correctional Services Ministry spokesperson Chrispin Phiri said to avoid future prison breaks, all facilities across the country will be assessed. On Friday, 68 inmates -- most of them gang members -- escaped from the prison. Police arrested 65 inmates shortly after the escape while three more were captured this weekend. Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola says the escapees will be dealt with harshly.

"The escapees overpowered the officials, took the keys and locked three of them in a cell and opened the other cells before escaping through the main entrance and over the roof," Lamola said. Before leaving, the inmates raided the prison kiosk for supplies. Lamola confirmed that nine warders were injured in the prison break and that counselling was provided to all members on duty at the time.
