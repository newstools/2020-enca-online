Grade 6, 11 and some grade R pupils are returning to class on Monday. "I feel quite anxious, one of my grandchildren is in a boarding school but I have to accept that he has to go to school.

"We understand that it is an emotionally taxing period, it is very stressful and parents are anxious about their children but if you do indeed feel anxious there is no pressure to send your child to school.
