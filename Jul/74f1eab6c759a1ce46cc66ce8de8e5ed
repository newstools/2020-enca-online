Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - A shortage of oxygen, critical care beds and nursing staff. These are major problems the Eastern Cape is grappling with as it braces for a peak in COVID-19 cases next month. Over 67,000 people are now infected, the third-highest number in the country. READ: Eastern Cape COVID-19 death toll climbs to 871 But as Parliament’s Health Committees have heard, district hospitals in particular, are not equipped to deal with the expected surge. It’s estimated at least 9000 people could die from the coronavirus in the Eastern Cape. Authorities say they will need another field hospital in the Buffalo City Metro to deal with referrals from the districts. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
