JOHANNESBURG - Radisson Hotel Group has added six hotels to its African portfolio as the company pushes ahead with its expansion strategy on the continent despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Global hotel chains, including Marriot International and Hyatt Hotels have increased investments in Africa, which has some of the world's only growing economies even after the impact of the pandemic, and a rising middle class. The addition of the new properties in Mali, Nigeria, Ghana, Ethiopia and two in South Africa means Radisson manages nearly 100 hotels in 32 African markets.
