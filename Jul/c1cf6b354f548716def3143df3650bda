READ: Journalist shot at during lockdown Professor Anton Harber from the Wits journalism department says many media houses have been slow in moving towards digital platforms. "Many of our major media houses, have been unable or unwilling to show the boldness and experimentation with digital media and done what is necessary really to take print titles online or to build digital media that will move into the gaps created by these issues and these problems," Harber said.
