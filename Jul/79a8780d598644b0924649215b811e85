NEW DELHI - The Indian Premier League, the world's richest cricket tournament, will be held in the United Arab Emirates from September if India's government gives approval, the IPL chairman told AFP on Tuesday. The postponement of the Twenty20 World Cup until 2021 because of the coronavirus has opened the way for the suspended IPL to go ahead after multiple delays as the pandemic spread this year. The Board of Control for Cricket in India now wants to hold the tournament, which draws top cricket stars from around the world, from September until early November.
