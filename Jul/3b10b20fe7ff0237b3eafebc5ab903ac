READ: Principal shot dead outside KZN school SGB chairperson Nondumiso Mthembu said Madonsela was like a brother. "Our principal was like a brother to all of us, to the teachers to the governing body to all of us, to everyone because as much as I did not work with him daily, but every time when I was with him he always encouraged me just like he encouraged the teachers to do their best," Mthembu said. The teachers said although they're in pain and still coming to terms with their loss, learning must continue. Police are investigating a case of murder and attempted murder and say no arrests have been made. The motive for the crime is unclear.
