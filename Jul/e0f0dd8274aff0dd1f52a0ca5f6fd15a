Eskom is warning that the power grid is under pressure after a few of its generating units failed. The utility is estimating a shortage of some 1, 500 megawatts from the grid. This comes after news broke of Eskom's R4-billion overpayments to contractors at Medupi. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Eskom has called on the public to reduce their electricity consumption as two generation units are offline and the generation system is constrained. Eskom spokesperson Sikhonathi Mantshantsha warned if more generating units keep on failing, the utility will resort to load-shedding sooner than anticipated.
