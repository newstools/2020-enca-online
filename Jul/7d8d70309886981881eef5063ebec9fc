WELLINGTON - New Zealand Rugby on Friday revealed plans to drop South African teams and Argentina's Jaguares from Super Rugby next year, in what could herald a major shake-up for the struggling competition. NZR said the planned revamp of the flagship southern hemisphere club tournament would contain New Zealand's five existing teams, one from the Pacific and two to four from Australia. "We want teams that are competitive and that fans will want to watch go head-to-head, week-in, week-out," chief executive Mark Robinson said.

He said decisions made around the new competition were "extremely tough". "We have a huge amount of sympathy for what's happening to rugby in Argentina and South Africa and their inability to play at the moment and the uncertainty that's creating," he said.
