Names can be big money. And none more so than Nelson Mandela's. It's become a cash cow for entrepreneurs looking to build businesses in a tough economy. But, Madiba the brand can also be used for good. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Names can be big money and none more so than Nelson Mandela's. It's become a cash cow for entrepreneurs looking to build businesses in a tough economy. But, Madiba the brand can also be used for good. WATCH: 18th Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture In 2011, the Nelson Mandela Foundation launched a clothing line branded with the number 46664, Mandela's former prison number. It was part of an HIV fundraising campaign but later grew into a programme to tackle various other social ills. “We’ve actually expressed that concern over the years to say that all of us need to apply some reverence to the name so that we then at least can use it to progress of many around the world, not just South Africans. So the commodification of the name tends to happen and it’s something that we’re trying to push back against," said Nelson Mandela Foundation CEO, Sello Hatang. But Mandela’s name is not just about the big bucks. WATCH: Political parties reflect on Madiba's legacy Millions in proceeds from the 46664 line and the famous gold coins, sanctioned by Mandela himself, have gone to the recently completed Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital. The money is also being invested in education.
