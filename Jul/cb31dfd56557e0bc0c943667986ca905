Courtesy #DStv403   JOHANNESBURG - The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa resumed limited train services in some parts of the country on Wednesday. However, the United National Transport Union says Prasa is not ready to run rail services. Trains have been parked since the beginning of the lockdown. READ:Â Trains to operate with limited capacity "Prasa is currently running at 15% of its normal capacity, only 15%. Now you have a train waiting at an intersection, waiting for manual authorisation and that is where the problem starts," said the union's Sonja Casterns. The new world order seems to be working. https://t.co/jqjK62SFa4 On Tuesday, Transport Minister inspected several trains. Mbalula said the true test of whether the trains are properly equipped to run will be once they begin operations.
