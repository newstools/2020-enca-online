Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro has tested positive for the coronavirus. SAO PAULO - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said he tested positive for the novel coronavirus after months of playing down the severity of the virus and defying medical experts, even as the pandemic killed more than 65,000 people in his country. The right-wing populist told a group of television reporters that he had developed symptoms at the weekend. "It started on Sunday with a certain malaise and became worse throughout the day on Monday, feeling poorly, exhaustion, a bit of muscle ache, fever hit 38 (degrees Celsius)," he said.

Bolsonaro has emulated his political role model Donald Trump in voicing skepticism about the virulence of the virus, although the US president has moderated his tone.
