Equipped with masks, gloves, hand-sanitizer and other protective gear, officers have conducted over 14,000 roadblocks and maintained high visibility at taxi ranks, markets, malls and other areas of potential mass gathering, but there are a few bad apples. "There are a handful of officers who have embarrassed the organisation by breaking the very rules they were meant to enforce. But the majority of you continue to serve your country with excellence and pride throughout this pandemic," Cele said. The move from lockdown Level 5 to Level 3 has also seen a spike in the levels of crime. Cele says officers should ensure that the fight against Gender-Based Violence remains a priority throughout the pandemic and beyond. Police Minister Bheki Cele says South Africa has seen an increase in crime levels in areas where COVID-19 infections are on the rise.
