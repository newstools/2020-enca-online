Was audit firm PWC merely negligent or in fact complicit in looting and irregular expenditure at South African Airways? That’s the question that’s been raised at the State Capture Inquiry. JOHANNESBURG - PwC partner Pule Mothibe will take the stand again on Friday at the state capture inquiry. Mothibe was questioned for hours on Thursday about the firm’s time spent auditing the national carrier. The witness maintains they did what was required of them as auditors, mostly. PwC won an initial tender to audit SAA for one year. But, it spent an additional four years auditing the national carrier without those contracts going to tender.
