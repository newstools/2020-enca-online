Silva and Kongthong have contacted Uber Eats to ask them to lower the service fee to provide some reprieve, but not everyone is sure this will make a significant impact. Meanwhile, Uber Eats says its service fee is necessary to sustain its operations. It says it’s implemented various measures to help its partners during the COVID-19 crisis, like introducing a daily pay-out feature to help restaurant cash flows, instead of weekly.
