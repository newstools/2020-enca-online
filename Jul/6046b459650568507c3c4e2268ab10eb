There have been ongoing disagreements between the governing body SAFA and the PSL on when the league could resume. The PSL had hoped to get back on 18 July, but now a date has been set for 1 August. There were concerns that there would not be enough time to conclude the season, but the green light from FIFA means local football can be flexible, on when they'll finish. CEO Tebogo Motlanthe says match officials will be ready for next month.
