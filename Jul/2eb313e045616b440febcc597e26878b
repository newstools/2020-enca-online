Health Minister Zweli Mkhize urged citizens to respect the recommended hygiene measures. "As government, we have mobilised every resource.... But government cannot manage this unilaterally," he said in a statement. "We see poor or no social distancing in communities. Masks are abandoned or not worn properly," he said. "This will directly influence the rise in numbers in the next two weeks. Our ability to break the cycle of infections depends on our willingness to remain focused and disciplined and take non-pharmaceutical interventions seriously," the minister said.
