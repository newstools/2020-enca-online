Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - New research from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases shows that a third of patients admitted with COVID-19 have at least one comorbidity. Most patients suffer from diabetes, obesity, hypertension and cancer. Chairperson of the COVID-19 Ministerial Advisory Committee, Professor Salim Abdool Karim, says three measures are being used when looking at the virus. "We look at three measures when we look at this disease in order to ensure that not any one of them is skewed. COVID-19: SA death toll up to 2657, infections soar "The first thing we look at is how many people are testing positive? Then you want to know how many of those patients are getting admitted to hospital and among those you want to know how many are dying and so we look at all three measures," he said. Nearly 7000 new COVID-19 cases take the total number of infections to more than 150,000. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
