"Home Affairs told me they can’t find my fingerprints, and that there are three of us using the same ID," she said. Malao says she has been unsuccessfully trying to acquire her ID since 2016. Over time, the situation has caused her emotional and financial distress. With COVID-19 cases rising in South Africa, Malao's greatest fear is dying without an ID.
