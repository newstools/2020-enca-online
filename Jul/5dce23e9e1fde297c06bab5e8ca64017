Since their homes were destroyed by floods in December last year many displaced residents have been housed at the Mamelodi Baptist Church. Government had promised to move them in January but that didn’t happen.

"The main contractor had offered them some stake but they are saying it is insufficient and they want us as the city to extend the scope of the project so that they could benefit and that has delayed the process of relocating the flood victims," said City of Tshwane spokesperson, Selby Bokaba. Bokaba says the first phase of relocating residents is expected to begin next week.
