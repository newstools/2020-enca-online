READ: Cell C plans to retrench 40% of staff Businesses have called on the government to step in to save jobs. Businessman Vusi Thembekwayo took to social media to express his outrage. "I think, like most South Africans, I am at the end of my tether. That office <pictured in Thembekwayo's video> is not mine. It's not our business but it's a company that shared our office block and they occupied the entire third floor." "They had about 200 people on that third floor. they've retrenched not only those 200 but 500 the country over and it is off the back, clearly, of COVID but more importantly off the back of what has been economic mismanagement of the past 26 years in South Africa and more acutely over the past two years of what's been a real recession in the real economy," Thembekwayo said.
