JOHANNESBURG - ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule on Friday mentioned receiving a missed call from the Botswana Democratic Party. But he didn’t divulge what it was about. Speculation is rife it could have been in connection with the troubles brewing between Botswana and high profile South African businesswoman, Bridgette Motsepe-Radebe. WATCH: Motsepe-Radebe hits back over Botswana bank scandal Botswana accuses her of being involved in money-laundering and fraud to the tune of R140-billion. A political analyst says the ANC remaining tight-lipped on the matter is just making things worse. “If ANC was really honest, surely they were going to restrain Bridgette Mostepe," said Benedict Xolani Dube.

"The way she’s doing things and the way she’s uttering statements, she’s uttering statements in such a way that Botswana, especially Masisi, must succumb to her interests.” Analysts also say the cancellation of State Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo's visit to Botswana was mysterious, seeing that the reason given for the initial visit would not have fallen under her portfolio.

"They say it's about Dlodlo going there to discuss SACU. Which is a kind of different explanation looking at the fact that SACU is a highly technical issue of economics and finance." The Botswana Democratic Party says it remains committed to having strong ties with the ANC as two liberal parties with historical history. etv news rigorously tried to get comment from the ANC, which is yet to respond.
