Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa is not telling smokers when they'll be able to buy cigarettes. But he's assured smokers they will eventually be able to enjoy a puff again. Ramaphosa held a virtual imbizo with ordinary South Africans on Wednesday. READ: Fita application to have cigarettes declared essential dismissed "The ban on cigarettes will be lifted. It is still in place in terms of the regulations and I think we should accept it as such and with time as we go to another and another level, the ban on cigarettes will also be lifted," said Ramaphosa. He's again appealed for compliance with lockdown regulations. Last week, a Fita application to have cigarettes deemed essential services during the lockdown has been dismissed. The High Court in Pretoria said a product's addictive properties do not mean it can be deemed essential during the lockdown. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
