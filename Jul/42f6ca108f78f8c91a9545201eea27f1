Arsenal's Argentinian goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez (C) celebrates with teammates on the pitch after the English Premier League football match between Arsenal and Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in London on July 15, 2020. Arsenal won the game 2-1 LONDON- Arsenal ended Liverpool's bid to set a new Premier League points record with a 2-1 win over the champions, while Manchester City pushed Bournemouth closer to relegation with a 2-1 victory on Wednesday. Jurgen Klopp's side needed to win their final three games of the season to break Manchester City's record of 100 points set in 2018. They were on course when Sadio Mane opened the scoring with a clinical finish from Andrew Robertson's cross at the Emirates Stadium. But two careless mistakes condemned Liverpool to a third league defeat this season.

Alisson was guilty of an equally costly blunder when his pass out was intercepted by Lacazette and he picked out 20-year-old Reiss Nelson for a cool close-range finish. Liverpool have failed to win three of their five matches since clinching the title. They have 93 points and with just two games left and can only reach 99 at the end of their first title-winning campaign for 30 years. "Twice there was a massive lack of concentration. We took a break after 1-0. Those two moments killed the game for us," Klopp said. "You can't win games when you concede chances like that. We have to learn from it, 100 per cent." Arsenal climb to ninth place as they chase qualification for the Europa League.
