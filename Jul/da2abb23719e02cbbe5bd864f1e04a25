Initially, the service was aimed at helping elderly residents in Langa. When lockdown was implemented, Cloudy Deliveries became a hit with even more locals. The business started out with seven second-hand bicycles, which frequently broke down. With the help of local government and NGOs, it has grown to a company with 21 bicycles. Mkosi says one of his goals is to tackle youth unemployment.
