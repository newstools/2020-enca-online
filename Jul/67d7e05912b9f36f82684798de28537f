READ: Eskom avoids load-shedding Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha says Stage 2 load-shedding will resume on Saturday from 9am until 10pm. The power utility said, “even though some of the units are expected back in service tonight, continuing with load-shedding tomorrow is necessary to replenish the emergency generation reserves to better prepare for the coming week." LOAD-SHEDDING: Schedules, info, and how it affects you Mantshantsha said the cold weather has also increased demand for electricity. Eskom said 3 of the 6 generation units have been restored at the Tutuka, Arnot and Matimba power stations.
