Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - AmaBhaca King Madzikane II Thandisizwe Diko has stated he did nothing illegal in a controversial R125-million deal with the Gauteng Department of Health. Two tenders, amounting to a R125-million contract, were awarded to Royal Bhaca, a company owned by presidential spokesperson, Khusela Diko's husband, King Madzikane II. Gauteng Premier David Makhura said the allegations of corruption have eroded public confidence in the government. READ: Jacob Mamabolo appointed acting-Gauteng Health MEC Diko said he was not approached by anyone prior to the deal being arranged and cancelled the contract on the urging of his wife. The king confirmed he has a company with Johannesburg's MMC for Group Corporate and Shared Services Loyiso Masuku but said it has never traded. Khusela Diko took voluntary leave from her position as the presidential spokesperson earlier this week. Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku has been placed on special leave while the case is investigated.
