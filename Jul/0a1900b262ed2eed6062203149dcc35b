File: Eskom is urging residents and businesses to use power sparingly. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom has stated there is a high possibility of load-shedding on Thursday evening. Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha said the delay of some generation units being brought back online and breakdowns in other units have caused the system to be severely constrained.

The return to service of a generation unit each at Duvha and Kendal power stations have been delayed. Mantshantsha said the power utility will communicate changes as they happen to the public and asked that consumers reduce demand as much as possible. #PowerAlert 1
