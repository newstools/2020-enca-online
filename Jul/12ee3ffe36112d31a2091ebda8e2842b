The Durban July is one of the continent’s premier horse racing events. It’s known for attracting the who’s who of South African high society and punters with outrageous fashion sense. But this year the race will take place behind closed doors under COVID-19 restrictions with none of the customary glitz and glamour.

But it was a very different edition, as the COVID-19 pandemic forced organisers to host the event behind closed doors as a Virtual July Experience. Trainer Justin Snaith had five horses in the race but Belgarion brought him his third Durban July title.

Horses weren't the only attraction, and despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, fashion was still part of the first-ever virtual Durban July. Young designers were able to showcase their creations online through the Durban Fashion Fair this week.
