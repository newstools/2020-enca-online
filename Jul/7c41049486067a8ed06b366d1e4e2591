He’s employed two villagers to help him after fruitless attempts by community members to get the road fixed by government. READ: Eastern Cape to continue using scooters Thanduluntu Nogqala and his small team have been at it since February. "I use this road often. I don't have a car so I get lifts from other people," he said. "The ride gets so bumpy it’s as though you're not even inside a car. I see a lot of wheels getting damaged."

"There are times where we get only R100 or R200 a day. Then it's difficult to pay the helpers but they don't get discouraged," said Nogqala. "I motivate them and say that one day we'll be successful because of these humble beginnings."
