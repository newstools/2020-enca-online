Isithwalandwe Andrew Mlangeni Virtual Memorial Service. JOHANNESBURG - South African anti-apartheid campaigner Andrew Mlangeni, who was jailed alongside Nelson Mandela in 1964 after a treason trial and died at the age of 95 was memorialised on Sunday. Mlangeni, who spent 26 years in jail and was the last of the eight defendants in the trial to die, had been admitted to hospital following an abdominal complaint. WATCH: Andrew Mlangeni remembered The struggle veteran was honoured by members of the ANC as well as his family in a live-streamed memorial service. Tokyo Sekgwale shared his memories of the late Mlangeni, saying he would be proud to see the ANC gathered now, arm in arm. Sekgwale said Mlangeni should not just be remembered as someone who spoke out against former President Jacob Zuma but as a principled man and fighter. ANC treasurer-general Paul Mashatile said even in his last days, Mlangeni dedicated his time to ensuring an ideal South Africa could be achieved. President Cyril Ramaphosa, who fought with Mlangeni for racial equality and an end to white minority rule, described him as a "beacon of ethical leadership and care for humanity" whose death marked the end of a generation of history and left the future in the hands of those who remained. "With his passing... Mlangeni has indeed passed the baton to his compatriots to build the South Africa he fought to liberate and to reconstruct," he said. Mlangeni championed the values needed to do this, including dignity and opportunity for all, and his "dramatic life was a unique example of heroism and humility inhabiting the same person," Ramaphosa said. Mlangeni was born in 1925. In 1951, he joined the youth wing of the African National Congress (ANC), which is now in power, and was later sent abroad for military training. READ: Tributes pour in for struggle icon Andrew Mlangeni On his return in 1963, he was arrested and stood trial alongside seven others including Mandela in what became known as the Rivonia trial, named after the suburb of Johannesburg where some of them were arrested. Mlangeni was sentenced to life imprisonment and sent with Mandela to Robben Island prison, the main jail used at the time for Black male anti-apartheid prisoners. After his release, he served as a member of parliament and lived in the township of Soweto, outside Johannesburg, until his death. Mlangeni will be laid to rest on Wednesday morning. #RIPAndrewMlangeni As we mourn this gentle giant, the family has a plea and is that the powers that be ensure the procurement processes around Bab’s Mlangeni’s burial ceremony are handled in a transparent manner, to portray the integrity and dignity that he stood for. Those who knew Isithwalandwe ubab’uMlangeni well, say he was an early riser. True to form, he was the first to arrive at an elective conference of the ANCYL on the morning of 5 September 2015. So I couldn’t resist a moment with him. #RIPAndrewMlangeni pic.twitter.com/KhADFbDbBB The news of Baba Andrew Mlangeni’s passing this morning has brought the end to the Rivonia Trialists. They are now all gone. May his soul rest in perfect and eternal peace.
