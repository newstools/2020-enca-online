Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Health Minister Zweli Mkhize says the ban on alcohol restriction is evidence-based. “We would like to assure South Africans that the alcohol restriction is very much evidence-based. Studies have revealed that we, unfortunately, do not have a healthy relationship with alcohol,” said Mkhize. WATCH: Alcohol sales suspended with immediate effect The Health Minister said during level four and five of lockdown, a study by Parry et al showed that there was a 60- 70% reduction in trauma admissions. According to Mkhize, some modeling was done to predict the impact of an alcohol ban, where it was “demonstrated that the reintroduction of an alcohol ban could result in 20% reduction of all trauma and 40% reduction of all alcohol-related trauma by the third week.” COVID-19 Regulations: Impact of alcohol sales ban Mkhize said the country expected a spike in COVID-19 cases between July, August and September.
