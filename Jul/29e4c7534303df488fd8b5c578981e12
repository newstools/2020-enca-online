"In terms of 2021 versus 2022 we just want to see two great events go ahead in India and Australia," Hockley said. "If it’s 21, the plans are really, really well progressed -- we’re really well placed to deliver on that. But .... equally, if it’s 2022, it will be a fantastic event. "In many ways, it gives a little bit more time to create even more additional certainty around it, the health situation because I think one thing, no-one knows how long this is going to last."
