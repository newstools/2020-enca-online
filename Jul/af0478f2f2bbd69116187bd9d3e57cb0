READ: Gauteng becomes COVID-19 epicentre "We are here to see how things are tying up in terms of additional beds being available so that no one should be turned away and told that there are no beds available." "There are those who might not be admitted and that is because of the doctor's decision. No person should be turned away because there is no space. It should be because the clinical judgement is that you should be treated elsewhere and not at the hospital," said Mkhize.
