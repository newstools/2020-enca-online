Auditor-General Kimi Makwetu will release local government audit results for the 2018-19 financial year. JOHANNESBURG - Auditor General Kimi Makwetu is to release local government audit results for the 2018\19 financial year. The previous data showed an overall decline in audit results. Makwetu has said the undesirable state of deteriorating audit outcomes shows that various local government role players have been slow in implementing, and in many instances even disregarding the audit officeâ€™s recommendations. As a result, the accountability for financial and performance management continues to worsen in most municipalities.
