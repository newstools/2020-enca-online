WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump said that rapper Kanye West's declaration that he is running for president was "very interesting." Responding to West's claim that he would run against Trump -- for whom the musician has expressed support in the past, Trump told reporters at the White House, "He may." The declaration by West on Twitter that he was gunning for the highest office in the land was retweeted half a million times and "liked" a million.

West, who visited Trump in the Oval Office in 2018 and donned a trademark "Make America Great Again" red baseball cap, announced his proposed run on Saturday, as the country celebrated Independence Day. "We must now realise the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future," the music and fashion mogul said.
