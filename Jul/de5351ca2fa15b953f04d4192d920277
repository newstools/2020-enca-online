PRETORIA - The City of Tshwane blames low revenue collection for its inability to make outstanding payments to workers in terms of their new salary grades. The South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) says if the city puts its mind to it, it can find the money. Union members are refusing to go back to work until they get their full back-pay. The workers have refused to back down from demands for better pay after a series of protests that brought the country's capital to a standstill.

However, municipal workers say this doesn't go far enough. They're struggling and want their outstanding back pay.

We’ve accumulated enough," said Samwu regional chairperson Nkhetheni Muthavhi. "They must find the R700-million, that's all we're demanding." The Metro says it's expecting workers back at their posts next week. But it appears it might be a while before the union can convince workers to accept the city's offer. Municipal workers continue to protest in the Pretoria CBD. SAMWU says it will not accept anything less than the promised pay #increases. #eNCA Courtesy #DStv403 pic.twitter.com/hxusbLLzr2
