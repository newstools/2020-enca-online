Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The COVID-19 pandemic is creating uncertainty over whether local government elections can be held next year but, the Electoral Commission says it’s on track to hold the polls. Over 90-percent of the 26.5-million registered voters have had their addresses captured. By law, the next local government elections have to be held by no later than 1 November 2021.

Already the COVID-19 pandemic has delayed the process of determining ward boundaries. The Electoral Act also has to be amended before the next municipal polls, to protect personal information contained on the voters’ roll. There are also still 1.2-million voters who don’t have an address attached to their name.

Despite the uncertainty, the IEC is forging ahead with plans to modernise the voting process - with an online registration system. It will also be replacing the controversial zip zap machines, with a new voter management device to minimise attempts at double voting. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
