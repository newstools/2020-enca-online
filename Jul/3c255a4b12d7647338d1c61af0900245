Every year, millions of people gatherÂ on the Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro to ring in the new year. RIO DE JANEIRO - The annual New Year's Eve celebrations which traditionally see millions of people gathered on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro have been cancelled this year as Brazil grapples with surging coronavirus infections, city authorities said. The celebrations are "not viable in this pandemic scenario, without a vaccine," the city's tourism office said in a statement, noting that the world-famous Carnival celebrations, normally set for February, might also have to be cancelled. Instead, a virtual New Year's celebration was being planned. "There is no great reason to celebrate, with more than 80,000 deaths" from coronavirus in Brazil, an official told AFP. But later, after hotels and others in the tourism industry complained, the tourism office Riotur backtracked and said it was seeking some kind of alternative to the big bash on the beach. One idea being floated is to do it on several beaches. A decision on Rio's world-famous Carnival celebrations will come later. Earlier this month some of Rio's biggest samba schools said they will not participate unless a vaccine is widely available. Sao Paulo said Friday it was indefinitely postponing its 2021 Carnival because of the pandemic.
