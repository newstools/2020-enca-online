Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The community living around the Vaal Dam is concerned about the water level that's been dropping for weeks. It fears that water restrictions will be implemented, which will negatively impact the area's key sectors of agriculture and hospitality. The dam, which supplies water to Gauteng, has been dropping by a percentage every week and is currently just under 29-percent full.

Community leader, Michael Brucher said, "the levels are dropping so rapidly that it is becoming a very big cause for concern not only for people consumption of the water required to keep Gauteng operable but also from industry, without you cannot run power stations."
The Vaal Dam level plummeted to 28.7-percent this week after a series of heatwaves and no rain. READ: Raw sewage continues to plague Vaal residents Meanwhile, the government said there is no need for alarm.
Spokesperson for the Water and Sanitation Department, Sputnik Ratau said, "we're still in a situation that does not really lead us to panic. "We still have the reserve dam, which is Sterkfontein, that is still at about 94 percent. We have not even come to a point where we need to draw water from Sterkfontein that will only happen once the Vaal Dam reaches 20 percent and below." The current dam level is in striking contrast to the same period last year when it was 54.8 percent and 87.4 percent in 2018.
According to the department, the levels are expected to continue to keep dipping in the coming months.
