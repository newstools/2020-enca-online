The community says Mohlanka must be dealt with harshly. On Monday, they threatened to burn down her house.

"There is no other justice -- she must suffer the same fate." Mwandile's grandmother Nompumelelo Zitho said she doesn't sleep at night. "It's still painful. Since April I sleep using pills. I don't feel well that she is released."
