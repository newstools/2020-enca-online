This follows reports earlier this week, that an arrest warrant has been issued for Magashule, something the Hawks denied. His supporters say any arrest warrant is aimed at settling political scores. READ:Â Former Free State MEC says Magashule must 'face the music' "You will remember it was us in the ANC who came out to speak on a rumour that would have suggested that the secretary-general was going to be arrested and indeed the SG, together with his legal team have also come out in the open to clarify that there was no warrant of arrest. There was no need really for the ANC to still be making commentary on that matter because we felt that it was sufficiently resolved," said ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe. Magashule's supporters say any arrest warrant is aimed at settling political scores. The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation described the report as a malicious intent to undermine the integrity of the organisation. A former ally-turned-foe says Ace Magashule must get what's coming to him. eNCA reporter Michael Appel sat down with former Free State Social Economic Development MEC Mxolisi Dukwana.

We might not be saying, "he is guilty" but surely he has to answer. "Failure to act is actually an offence. If there are problems in moral decision-making processes, you must face the music," Dukwana said.
