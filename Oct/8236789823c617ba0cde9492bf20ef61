READ: Alleged victim cross-examined at Malema Ndlozi assault trial Venter allegedly refused to allow them into the private burial ceremony, claiming they never had a permit. Their defence lawyer said Venter has a political motive and that his testimony does not match the CCTV footage of the image. READ: Malema hits back at AfriForum Malema addressed supporters outside the Randburg magistrate's court following his appearance. He spoke about various topics including questions around the race of his legal representation, wealth and land distribution and the employment of foreign nationals by local businesses. "Ours is an international struggle, it is not tribalistic struggle and it’s not a racist struggle." Malema was positive about the case, saying they will achieve victory when the case resumes next year. "Our case is postponed to March next year but there is no case. We must never worry about that. When they worry on the facts of the case, we worry about taking over [the] government," he said.
