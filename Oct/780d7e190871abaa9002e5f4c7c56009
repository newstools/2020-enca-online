"It is quite alarming, the other, almost 30% say sometimes or usually wear a mask but almost 71% always wear a mask. "We didn't actually ask reasons why people actually do or do not wear a mask but in some of the comments in our survey, we got an idea that a lot of people are fed up with masks since now that the lockdown has been going for such a long time," he said. South Africa currently has 712 thousand 412 cases of Coronavirus.
