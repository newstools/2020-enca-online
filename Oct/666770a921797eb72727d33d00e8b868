BRUSSELS - , Mariya Gabriel has tested positive for COVID-19, she said Saturday, the first top Brussels official known to have caught the coronavirus.

"After a first negative #COVID19 test on Monday, my second one is positive," said Gabriel, who is Bulgaria's representative to the 27-member EU executive. "I have been in self-isolation since Monday and continue staying at home, following the established regulations. Keep yourself healthy and stay safe!" she said.
