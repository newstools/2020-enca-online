Solomzi Nqweni calls it random, the moment when Guillain-Barre’ Syndrome came knocking. He remembers it as the weekend of the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup final. Guillain-Barré syndrome is a disorder where your immune system attacks the body’s nerve cells, leaving you with paralysis. He had just played for Scottish club Aberdeenshire on the Saturday before the horror experience. By early Monday morning, the 26-year-old was admitted to hospital, thanks to the quick action of Scottish health officials.
