Ant Group runs Alipay, the dominant online payment system in China, where cash, cheques and credit cards have long been eclipsed by e-payment devices and apps. AFP/STR BEIJING -Â Chinese e-payments giant Ant Group said it plans to raise $34-billion in a joint Asian listing, making it the biggest IPO in history. The cash raised from the split float between Hong Kong and Shanghai would be far more than the $29-billion chalked up by Saudi Aramco in December. The financial arm of Chinese e-commerce titan Alibaba, Ant Group runs Alipay, the dominant online payment system in China, where cash, cheques and credit cards have long been eclipsed by e-payment devices and apps. According to statements released by Ant Group, the e-payments behemoth aims to sell 1.67 billion shares each at HK$80 ($10.30) in Hong Kong from Tuesday. A further 1.67-billion shares will be sold in Shanghai at 68.80 yuan ($10.30). The total sale would therefore exceed $34-billion, and could be close to $40-billion if over-allotment options are taken up. The securities will begin trading on November 5. Ant claims an annual transaction volume exceeding 118 trillion yuan, with more than 700 million monthly active users. Its entry into Shanghai and Hong Kong comes after Beijing called on national flagships of the technology sector to list on domestic stock exchanges, in a period of sharp economic and political rivalry with the US.
