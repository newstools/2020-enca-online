READ: CRL Commission hears disturbing testimony about KwaSizabantu On Wednesday, church leaders stormed out of the hearings - upset that the commission chair, Luka Mosoma wouldn't recuse himself. "We would therefore ask that the proper thing is for, at the very least, the chairman to recuse himself and we have to run the integrity of other commissions, we are not sure if they also reached these conclusions before they heard us", the church's legal representative, advocate Keith Matthee said The commission said it will wait until the church decides whether to make a presentation. "For now we'll wait for them to come back to us, but we will continue with our investigative hearings in Gauteng in Cape Town. There are many interests of people that have called us from overseas, who were part of that institution, who would like to weigh-in and give us their testimonies and their experiences," Mosoma said. The investigation is expected to conclude within two months. Watch the video above for more on this story.
