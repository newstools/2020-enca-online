Questions around murder-accused Zane Kilian's certification as a private investigator is causing confusion. The Institution that certified him apparently doesn't know him. Ayesha Ismail sifts through the facts. Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - In another twist in the Charl Kinnear assassination case, the Mitchell's Plain institution, where murder-accused Zane Kilian's certification as a private investigator is from, does not know of him. Kilian's lawyer presented the certificate to court earlier this week, as proof that his client had acted within the law as a registered investigator. When eNCA approached Kilian's lawyer about the discrepancy, he said it was for his client to answer. Prosecuting authorities are confident Kilian has a case to answer. READ: Kilian's bail application moved to another court The matter has now been moved to the Bellville Regional Court because the Bishop Lavis Court, where Kilian has been appearing, was deemed a security risk. But, it's not just Kilian's bail application that's become a big focus in this case. The former professional rugby player, not only faces murder charges, but also one of unlawfully intercepting communication. He'd allegedly been trackingÂ Kinnear's phones for months. Previously, Kilian's advocate, Eckhard Rosemann used a document to prove his client was registered with the Private Security Industry Regulating Authority (PSiRA). It would give Kilian the right to trace and track clients. READ: Another delay in Kinnear murder case However, in an email, the regulating authority says its records show that Kilian is not registered with them. What's more, the company listed on his qualifications, Wise Guys Security Training Academy, also says Kilian was never its student. Watch the video above for more on this story.
