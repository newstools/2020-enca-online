CSA Board member John Mogodi said, "at the outset, I would like to dispel any misconceptions of insolence and defiance in matters relating to the release of the complete Forensic Report and reaffirm CSA's commitment to transparency." The stand-off between SASCOC and Cricket South Africa continues. Yesterday the umbrella body indicated that CSA refuses to hand over the forensic report they commissioned in 2016. That information was used to dismiss Thabang Moroe just a few months ago. Courtesy #DStv403 The report released is a summarised version, with some details redacted. The blame for the governance crisis at CSA is being placed at dismissed CEO Thabang Moroe's feet. Eleven of twenty areas of concern were under Moroe's watch, according to the report.

Sascoc, who had requested the full report, was also not informed of the media engagement and the decision to release parts of the report.

"We don't want to be misinformed or have a misperception of issues unless we read the full un-summarised and unredacted version of the report." Sascoc maintains its resolution to appoint an independent task team to look into CSA's affairs remains.
