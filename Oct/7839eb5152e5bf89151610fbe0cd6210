"They managed to restore the service on Wednesday evening, which meant that they were able to pump water from their reservoirs into ours. Due to the fact that during the day of the outage, most of our reservoirs also ran dry, we had to also close them down to protect the infrastructure." Dhudhlu said all but one of the city's reservoirs have recovered on Friday. Aukland Park, Coronationville, Clairmont, and Sophiatown are affected by the Hurst Hill reservoir issue but Johannesburg Water has said those areas will be supplied with water soon. Water supply to Ennerdale and all extensions will be implemented from 9 pm on Friday to ensure weekend water supply. Johannesburg Water has asked residents to reduce their water consumption to allow the reservoirs to recover.
