Durban Gen launches 5 October at 6:30pm on e.tv. DURBAN - The story of Durban Gen is set in the heart of Newlands East, a township in Durban, where the most prominent and recognizable academic public hospital, Durban General, is found. A highly acclaimed hospital that is the jewel of KZN healthcare. The centre of excellence where every doctor wants to practice and every patient wants to be treated. The story follows the life of the main protagonist, Mbali Mthethwa, a newly qualified doctor who moves to the big city, away from her fiancé and the small town they grew up in, to serve her final year of community service at Durban General Hospital. However, she finds herself torn between two men. Her fiancé Sibusiso Dlamini, the one she has promised herself to, and her superior, Dr. Lindelani Zulu, a brilliant, attractive surgeon with whom she has undeniable chemistry. On arrival at Durban General Hospital, Mbali assists in a precarious surgery that goes horribly wrong, resulting in the death of an MEC. The incident plummets the hospital, Mbali, and Dr Lindelani Zulu, into the middle of an investigation that threatens to derail her career before it has even begun. Meanwhile, her proximity to Dr Zulu, the resulting intimacy, and their palpable chemistry threaten to break everything Mbali has built back home with Sbusiso.
