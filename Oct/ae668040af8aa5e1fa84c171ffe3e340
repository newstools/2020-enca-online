The app was created by those who attended a course run by Mbula Research and Development. "There are a number of reasons why we came up with this solution, one, last month the government launched the sign language charter, which compels government and the private sector sign language interpretation services are provided.

Ndhlovu says the organisation has been working with the group to also develop wearable technology that will help people who are communicating with a deaf person.
