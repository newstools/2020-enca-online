The workers, affiliated to the General Industrial Workers Union of SA, have handed over a revised memorandum of demands. Clover has set out Thursday and Friday for further negotiations.

It said many workers get exploited by not being permanently employed and over years, workers' complaints have grown. "There's a list of demands that have been there over the years and not taken care of by the employer, hence our demands are a long list," Charles Phahla, Giwusa deputy-general secretary said. "You might think our demands are unreasonable. We're not really unreasonable.

Phahla warned that the resumption of talks with management does not mean an end to the industrial action and said another march would be held on Monday as well as meetings with union allies over the weekend to coordinate more civil action. The union has reiterated its call for the country to boycott Clover products.
