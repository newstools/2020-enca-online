The gas deposit was found 175 kilometres offshore near another discovered early last year. "Total has made a significant gas condensate discovery on the Luiperd prospect... in the Outeniqua Basin," it said in a statement. "This discovery follows the adjacent play opening Brulpadda discovery in 2019, which proved a significant new petroleum province in the region."

Total exploration and production president Arnaud Breuillac said the second discovery showed "the world-class nature of this offshore gas play". In the statement, Breuillac added that Total had acquired "important data" on the reserves that would help the company engage with South African authorities on "possible conditions of... commercialization". Total holds a 45 percent stake in the block, alongside Qatari, British and South African firms.
