JOHANNESBURG - Human Rights Watch has revealed a shocking report on the treatment of people with mental health issues.

Sharma said families struggle to find support from formal institutions. "It is a widespread practice that is happening across 60 countries what we find because there is such a prevalent stigma. READ: SA mental health services neglected and underfunded "There is a lack of awareness of mental health. People believe that a mental health condition is as a result of being bewitched or being possessed by evil spirits. As a result, the first port of call is a traditional or a faith healer. When that does not work, they don't know what else to do. "They get worried that the person might run away, might get lost and as result, they turn to chaining. It is a practice that is happening across cultures, across religions, in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and Latin America." The organisation said governments must combat stigma, work with people with lived experiences, ban shackling and provide more community support and basic services to enable people with mental health conditions to thrive in their communities.
