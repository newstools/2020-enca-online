The Gauteng MK military veterans want the ANC to listen. JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng's busiest intersection, Gillooly's, was slower than usual on Monday as the uMkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association blockaded the R24 and the N12 splits. The veterans shut down the Gillooly's intersection in Ekurhuleni demanding that their grievances are heard. They want answers to a 2019 memorandum requesting that they be absorbed into the security cluster. They say the ANC in Gauteng hasn't kept its promise to absorb its members into suitable jobs in the province. At least 24 protesting military veterans were arrested and taken to Bedfordview police station. They have made it clear their protests won't stop here. eNCA reporter Nqobile Madlala shares more details about the protest in the video below.
