Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - All she wanted was to bond with her newborn baby. Instead, a freak accident means a Cape Town woman will spend weeks in hospital without her daughter. Jane Dzimbiri gave birth on 4 October. Then she suffered a fall in the operating room, leading to serious spinal injuries. Charles Dzimbiri never imagined he’d have to look after his newborn daughter, Tatenda, and 6-year-old son without his wife by his side. “They say she broke her spinal cord, which is the second one from the brain," he said. "According to the doctor, the spinal cord is a very complicated one which needs to be taken seriously.” It’s still unclear whether the fall was caused by negligence, or if it was a simple accident. The family can’t visit Jane due to COVID-19 restrictions and has to rely on video calls. The provincial health department says it’s investigating the incident. And while Charles Dzimbiri is waiting for answers about what happened, he also just wants his wife safely back home. * eNCA’s Monique Mortlock has the full video report above.
