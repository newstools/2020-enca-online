Mining Affected Communities United in Action wants communities to have the final say as to whether mining can take place. Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Mining Affected Communities United in Action wants communities to have the final say as to whether mining can take place. The Mineral Resources Department maintains this will slow down the process and the economy. Before big mining companies break ground, they are meant to first apply to the Mineral Resources and Energy Department for permission but those who live near these mines want to have a final say.

Meshack Mbangula, the national coordinator of Mining Affected Communities United in Action (Macua), said, "we should be consulted, meaningfully consulted and we should be able to raise our concerns like to say no to mining." Macua represents the interests of communities in the country's mining areas. It said mining companies simply exploit them, only to leave behind plenty of damage. They say the case between uMgungundlovu community in Eastern Cape and an Australian mining company is proof that their demands are valid. The North Gauteng High Court ruled in favour of the community that refused mining in the Xolobeni area, but the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy is appealing that decision. Department of Mineral Resources Director-General Thabo Mokoena said, "you can just imagine if you have to consult with each and every member of the community to give consent. The issue of economic activities and recovery we will not be able to achieve all those things."

Mining communities are hoping the Mineral Resources Department's appeal fails so they will have the power to negotiate the terms of mining in communities.
