LOS ANGELES - The Proud Boys hashtag has been hijacked This as the LGBTQI+ community flooded the feed of the far-right group with photos of their significant others, wedding pics and other pride imagery. Proud Boys was founded in 2016 and calls itself a "white chauvinist" organisation. The group was recently in the headlines after US President Donald Trump declined to condemn it in a presidential debate, instead telling the group to "stand back and stand by." Actor and gay rights activist George Takei decided to stir up a Twitter storm. He's described the hijacking as 'glorious' adding, 'We're very happy and proud. We are not standing back and standing by, we are standing up and speaking out.'
