JOHANNESBURG - US President Donald Trump said he "learned a lot about COVID" by "really going to school" as he has battled the virus in hospital. "I learned a lot about COVID, I learned it by really going to school," Trump said in a video posted to Twitter. "This is the real school. This isn't the 'let's read the books school,' and I get it, and I understand it, and it's a very interesting thing." While still receiving treatment for coronavirus, Trump has left his ward with his security detail on Sunday so he could ride in an SUV past supporters cheering him on outside Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. An attending physician at the hospital has criticised the drive-by as a risk to the lives of Secret Service agents who accompanied him.
