Advocate Gerrie Nel said the challenge now is to bring the mastermind behind the murder to justice.

"it's not my belief [that Meyiwa was assassinated], I received the briefing from the South African Police Service, from the investigating officer, from the investigating team. That's also their belief." The advocate said the facts point to the assassination and said Afriforum felt it was their duty to share that information with the family. Nel said he shares the view of Police Minister Bheki Cele that the state has a strong case against the accused.
