CAPE TOWN - A Capetonian hero has made it to his final resting place, two months after his fearless act made headlines. Tanzanian national Yusuf Kiriboto drowned while trying to save the life of eight-year-old girl Abieda Paulse from the Vygieskraal informal settlement who fell into an Athlone canal. While both their bodies were found 12 days later, only the girl was buried at the time, almost immediately in accordance with Muslim rites. Kiriboto’s body lay in the mortuary for over two months due to red tape. “It has been an uphill struggle to get the body released for burial because brother Yusuf had no identification and his mother is in Addis Ababa," said Al Jama-ah MP Ganief Hendricks. "There were so many endeavours to get the body released. "The MJC, The Muslim Burial Society, the ANC and even the Mayor of Cape Town sent people to the mortuary to get the body released.” But all these attempts failed and Al Jama-ah had to seek the help of the high court to get Kiriboto’s body for burial.
