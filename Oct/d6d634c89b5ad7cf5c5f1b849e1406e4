File: Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance is set to lay criminal charges against EFF leader, Julius Malema and EFF MP, Nazier Paulsen on Monday. This after a social media post that the party says incites violence. On Wednesday Malema tweeted “Cowards move to the back. Fighters attack” followed by the picture of a gun on Twitter.  Since the government of @CyrilRamaphosa is extremely scared to respond decisively, we are on our own. Next appearance, all ground forces and peace loving South Africans will be in attendance, in defence of our democracy and property. Magwala a chechele morago! Fighters attack! pic.twitter.com/HIddc4gOV3  pic.twitter.com/XF2dSJz6hS On Saturday, Paulsen uttered the same in a separate tweet. READ: EFF MPs could face action for Parliament disruptions The DA says their tweets are a response to protests by farmers in Senekal in the Free State last week. The party says the utterances are a serious offence by members of Parliament who are bound by an Oath of Office. The party has called on Police Minister Bheki Cele to act against the two, and plans to lay charges at the Cape Town police station on Monday.
