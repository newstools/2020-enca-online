André Pienaar is now out on bail of R15,000. JOHANNESBURG - A suspect arrested in connection with the Senekal riots has been granted bail. Andre Pienaar was arrested after a group of people damaged state property and set a police van alight two weeks ago. The group wanted authorities to hand over the two suspects arrested for the murder of farm manager Brendin Horner earlier this month. On Monday, the High Court in Bloemfontein overturned the magistrate's ruling denying Pienaar bail. READ: Brendin Horner's father speaks out Bail was set at R15,000.
