Zimbabwe's economy has been on a downturn for over a decade characterized by scarcity of foreign currency. ZIMBABWE - Zimbabwe's finance minister on Friday said the country’s economy, battered by drought and the COVID-19 pandemic this year, would recover in 2021. Presenting the 2021 pre-budget strategy paper in the capital, minister Mthuli Ncube said the economy was "confronted with climatic, macroeconomic and COVID-19 shocks" and is projected to contract by 4.5 percent in 2020. "From 2021, as with other global economies, the economy is expected to be out of the woods with a growth projection of 7.4 percent, riding on expected improvement in the climatic and investment conditions and planned strategies and programmes."

Zimbabwe's economy has been on a downturn for over a decade characterized by scarcity of foreign currency. President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took over from long-time ruler Robert Mugabe following a coup in 2017, pledged to revive the country's moribund economy and mend ties with its former trading partners in the west. But economic woes which plagued Mugabe’s rule have persisted.
