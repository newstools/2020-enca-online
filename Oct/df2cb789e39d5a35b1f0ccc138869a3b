EFF leader Julius Malema and MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi are back at the Randburg Magistrate's Court. There's a heavy police presence outside court as EFF members attend in numbers. eNCA's Siphamandla Goge has the details. #eNCA Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - EFF members have come out in their numbers to support Julius Malema and Mbuyiseni Ndlozi in court. The pair are facing charges of assaulting a police officer at the funeral of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in 2018. Court proceedings began on Wednesday, with the State arguing that both  Malema and MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi acted with a common purpose when assaulting police colonel Johan Venter. Both Malema and Ndlozi pleaded not guilty to the charge of common assault. WATCH: EFF's Malema, Ndlozi return to court Venter detailed his version of events of the alleged assault. He said Malema's vehicle did not have a visible permit allowing him to enter the cemetery before the funeral. He said he approached the driver and was informed the occupant is Malema. Venter said the vehicle drove inside the cemetery even though it was not given permission by any of the police officials to do so. Venter said his instructions were to only allow the immediate family members and the President entrance at the cemetery and that the rest of the mourners will follow proceedings from the big screens at the stadium. Venter stated Malema said no white man would stop him from entering the cemetery. He claimed he was then pushed several times by both Ndlozi and Malema. Venter admitted that both Malema and Ndlozi had personal permits around their necks, but insisted that he did not see a permit on their vehicle. The defence team began cross-examining Venter, pointing out contradictions between his testimony and initial affidavit. Venter testified that Malema and Ndlozi were not given permission to enter the cemetery. His statement of April 2018, however, suggests they were given permission.
