"I think today <Friday> has been a reminder of what we need to do, and do quickly, because it shows that people have been bottling up anger and the question is how do we diffuse the situation," he said. Motshekga said the narrative that South Africans have a common destiny must be instilled in people to dispel divisions between racial groups. "There is enough land for all of us in South Africa. If people can stop being greedy and say, "let's share" because it's also not correct to say there is a class of people who produce food for others. We all have the capacity to produce food," he said. Motshekga is the chairperson of the Ad Hoc committee on legislation to amend Section 25 of the Constitution.
