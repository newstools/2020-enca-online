Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Former Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku has vowed to challenge the SIU report used to discharge him of his responsibilities. He also wants the report set aside. Masuku broke his silence following an announcement by Gauteng Premier David Makhura, that he has been relieved of his duties. READ: SIU report for Ramaphosa's eyes only Masuku denies any wrongdoing in the controversial PPE scandal. He insists he did nothing dishonest, illegal or corrupt. Makhura emphasised the province intends to recoup the money misappropriated. Earlier, Makhura told a media briefing that he received a report last week on Friday "on the matter of the role of the Health MEC in the PPE" which stated, "Health MEC Bandile Masuku failed to execute his functions in compliance with the Constitution and the Public Finance Management Act" and recommended that the premier should take administrative action against the MEC. However, Makhura has made it clear that Masuku hasn't been found guilty of corruption. He says investigations into alleged PPE corruption are still ongoing. The current acting MEC Jacob Mamabolo will continue in the position while the investigation into acts of corruption and collusion around PPE procurement is completed. Makhura said Masuku could be reinstated as MEC should the SIU investigation exonerate him of collusion and corruption.
