File: Caster Semeya of South Africa runs in the 800m during the 2017 Prefontaine Classic Diamond League at Hayward Field on May 27, 2017 in Eugene, Oregon. JOHANNESBURG - Caster Semenya and her legal team will keep fighting, for her right to race in middle-distance events on her own terms. They are now heading for the European Court of Human Rights to lodge their latest challenge. Semenya is not racing in her favourite event, the 800 metres, because of World Athletics regulations regarding testosterone levels. She has lost previous legal challenges at the Court of Arbitration and the Swiss Supreme Court. Semenya's lawyer Greg Nott says her legal team is only following her directives.
