JOHANNESBURG - Anglican priest and social justice activist, Father Michael Lapsley has been awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Rhodes University for his dedication to the pursuit of social justice and human rights and dignity. READ: The Vula Connection - an untold apartheid story In 1990, Father Lapsley moved to Zimbabwe, while there he received a letter bomb from the apartheid regime disguised in a collection of religious magazines. He lost both his hands, sight in one eye and was severely burnt. Lapsley shared what inspired him to become a political activist, saying, "The short answer is my faith. As a child, I learned that we are all God's children, I could see that apartheid and racism was the opposite of the Christian gospel. I came to see that worshipping God and working for justice are two sides of the same coin." The human rights activist went on to say his work is far from over, "I further came to realise that God is not a Christian and the future of humanity is an interfaith future, also regardless of our sexual orientation, we are all first-class citizens in God's eyes. I have a part to play today in dismantling and unlearning patriarchal attitudes and practices which lead to violence by men against women." Lapsley said he is not filled with hatred for the perpetrators of the crime that injured him 30 years ago but said he has not had an opportunity to forgive them as it is still unknown who planned or executed the bombing. The priest said the need for shared "safe and sacred spaces" has prompted him to develop a method he calls the Healing of the Memories which he hopes will help South Africans begin intergenerational healing from apartheid.
