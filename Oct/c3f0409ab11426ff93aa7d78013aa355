"The system would then automatically check if there is a benefit that is potentially payable to you because the money doesn't actually sit with the FSCA, they sit with the retirement funds to which the person used to belong," she said. Potential beneficiaries can also SMS their ID number to 30913 or email an enquiry to pension.queries@FSCA.co.za.
