File: Finance Minister, Tito Mboweni. JOHANNESBURG - Finance Minister, Tito Mboweni is dismissing concerns that an IMF loan will be wiped out by paying public service salaries. But, he could not definitively say the money will not be used to service the public sector wage bill. Mboweni told Parliament the loan forms part of the National Revenue Fund.
