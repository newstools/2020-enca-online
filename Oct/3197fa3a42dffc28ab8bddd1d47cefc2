Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - President Cyril Ramaphosa has outlined plans to reignite the economy by creating jobs through infrastructure development. Government has committed R100-billion over the next three years to realise the plan. Ramaphosa'sÂ plan is to raise growth to around three-percent on average over the next 10 years. WATCH: SA's economic recovery plan unpacked "More than 60-thousand jobs will be created for labour-intensive maintenance and construction of municipal infrastructure and rural roads," Ramaphosa said. "To support our healthcare system an additional 6,000 community health workers and nursing assistants will be deployed as we proceed with the implementation of National Health Insurance." Fifty strategic projects are to be fast-tracked enabling R340-billion in new investment but the plan will rely heavily on a secure energy supply, which Ramaphosa is promising within the next two years.
