"These officials have a tendency of resigning whenever they realise that some evidence has been found out or they have been found out, either on the irregularities or even criminal matters and then they just submit their resignations," said SIU head, Andy Mothibi. "The unfortunate part is that by law if you put in a resignation then it becomes difficult to say you can't resign." Mothibi says other processes will be followed for those who have resigned.
