A Gautrain security official is seen standing at the door of the train at the Hatfield Station in Pretoria. JOHANNESBURG - Gautrain says it will provide a limited service on Sunday. The Gautrain did not operate at all on Saturday following failed negotiations between the Gautrain operator Bombela and Numsa. Workers are demanding an eight percent salary increase, while the employer is offering half this amount. Gautrain says it will operate from 9am until 6pm on both the East-West and North-South lines. Trains will be available every hour from both directions. On Monday and Tuesday, trains will operate during the standard morning and afternoon peak periods at 15-minute intervals.
