CANCUN - Hurricane Delta churned towards Mexico's Caribbean coast on Wednesday as thousands of tourists hunkered down in emergency shelters in a string of major beach resorts. The hurricane weakened to Category 3 as it approached the Yucatan Peninsula, but still threatened to bring strong winds and a "life-threatening" storm surge, the US National Hurricane Center said. On Tuesday Delta had intensified to an "extremely dangerous" Category 4 storm, according to the Miami-based centre. The hurricane was packing maximum sustained winds of 195km/h early on Wednesday, according to the Miami-based NHC.
