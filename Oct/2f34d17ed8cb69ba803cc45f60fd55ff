I would like to know why a person that has been arrested 16 times is given another chance to commit another crime." Nearly two weeks ago, the farm foreman was found murdered, apparently after he stumbled across stock thieves who turned on him. Photos of alleged stock thieves form part of an extensive dossier. Most startling is the alleged link to the police. Farmers who conducted their own investigations tracked cell phone numbers and vehicles to police officers. Horner's alleged murderers are expected back in court on Friday. Cele says the police will be deployed in their numbers to avoid a repeat of the violent scenes which played out last week.
