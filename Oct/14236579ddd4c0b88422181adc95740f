The community of Umlazi Township in KwaZulu-Natal has received free eye-testing on Saturday. This as Eye Care Awareness Month comes to an end. The event's organiser Phumlani Dube says his foundation joined forces with others to mark an end to this important month. “We are here to promote eye health and vision health which is very important and something that is always overlooked by almost everyone when the eyes are the most important organ in the body," Dube said. Eye care month is commemorated every year from 20 September to 17 October. It's to raise awareness about eye health, prevention and treatment of avoidable blindness. The Phumlani Dube foundation says it hopes to hold more events like this in future. * eNCA’s Lethiwe Mdluli has more. Watch the full report above.
