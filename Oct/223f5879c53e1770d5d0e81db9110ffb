Neil Coleman from the Institute said, "imagine that a grant of R350, for a month, has to get an unemployed person and their dependents through, it's unbelievable to imagine the struggles that people have. A caregiver's grant is R500."

"All the research shows the effects of the lockdown continue to be devastating for many, many people." Coleman estimates almost 13 million South Africans are grant recipients -- not including dependents -- and if it is not dealt with, will lead to a nationwide humanitarian crisis.
