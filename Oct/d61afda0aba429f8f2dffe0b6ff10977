Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - It's all systems go for Cosatu's mass national strike set for Wednesday. The federation union and others are calling on all public servants to stay away from work. They are demonstrating against exploitation of workers, corruption, gender-based violence and other socio-economic issues. WATCH: Cosatu gives update ahead of nationwide strike "The Federation is encouraging workers to exercise their right to challenge and contest this rigged economic system and we will be targeting government, private sector employers, and law enforcement agencies," a statement on the mass action reads. "We need to take a stand and push back against this flagrant theft of taxpayers funds and the disgraceful abandonment of the working class by policymakers and decisionmakers. The only way to undo this corrupt system is through disruption and non-cooperation and obstruction." READ: Cosatu plans nationwide corruption protest for October The union's General-Secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali said the strike will adhere to social distancing to avoid contributing to rising infections of the virus. Cosatu representatives called on workers to also "work to rule" until the stay-away, meaning only provide the services they are stipulated to provide by their contracts and refuse to accept duties they are not employed to fulfil.
