AFP/Manjunath Kiran DUBAI - Skipper Virat Kohli praised AB de Villiers' "super-human" effort on a sluggish pitch after the South African great hit a match-winning 73 for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League. Bangalore thrashed Kolkata Knight Riders by 82 runs in Sharjah as De Villiers stood tall with his 33-ball blitz and an unbeaten century stand with Kohli, who made 33. Bangalore posted 194 for two, a total their bowlers defended by keeping down Kolkata to 112 for nine in 20 overs. De Villiers brought the house down with two of his six sixes going out of the stadium and one hitting a moving car on the road as he went past 3,000 runs in the Twenty20 tournament. "Barring one super-human, everyone struggled on that pitch," Kohli said of his star player who hit his third half-century of the season on a slow Sharjah pitch. "It was unbelievable. I thought I had a few balls under my belt, and I might start striking. He just came in and struck the third ball, and said he felt good. "I said you might see a lot of people do what is done in other games, but only AB can did what he did. It was a fabulous knock. We were looking at 160-165, and it was only thanks to his genius we got to 195." De Villiers took the attack to the opposition bowlers with Kohli playing second fiddle at the other end as the duo scored 83 runs from the final 30 deliveries of the innings. "I am very happy with my performance. That's all I can say," De Villiers said after being named of the match. "I got a duck last game, that is a terrible feeling. I am very happy that I contributed. I surprised myself today to be honest."
