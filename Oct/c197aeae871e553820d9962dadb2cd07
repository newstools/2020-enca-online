Roy-Keane Avontuur of Stellenbosch FC is tackled by Keegan Ritchie of Swallows FC as he shoots at goal during the DStv Premiership 2020/21 game between Stellenbosch FC and Swallows FC at Danie Craven Stadium in Stellenbosch on 25 October 2020 JOHANNESBURG - Sunday's DSTV Premiership was all about the newcomers. As fate would have it, status buyers TS Galaxy and Tshakhuma met in Thohoyandou. While both teams are new to the Premiership, they do have the experience to call on. Journeyman Bevan Fransman drew first blood for Galaxy. But another experienced campaigner Mokgakolodi Ngele also had his say. He scored TTM's first-ever Premiership goal as it ended 1-all. Meanwhile, Swallows also made their return away to Stellenbosch FC. Poor judgement gave the Birds a chance to open their account early. Ruzaigh Gamildien converted to put the Birds in front at the Danie Craven Stadium. But Stellenbosch struck back with a spot kick of their own as it ended 1-all.
