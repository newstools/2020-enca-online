The new Pixel 5 will start at $699 for US customers and its reduced-price Pixel 4a with 5G at $499, the California tech giant announced at a streamed event. The phones will be available from October 15 in the US and other markets.

The announcement puts Google, for the moment, ahead of Apple in the 5G smartphone race, with a 5G iPhone widely expected to be unveiled in the coming weeks. It also positions Google with a competitively priced 5G device as consumers begin looking for upgrades. Google's Pixel handsets have won positive reviews for their powerful cameras and integrated artificial intelligence, but have failed to crack the top ranks of the smartphone market dominated by the likes of South Korea's Samsung, Apple and China's Huawei.

"Google has pivoted its Pixel line from competing at the highest price points to offering more value, but the competition has intensified in the mid-tier market as well," said Avi Greengart of the consultancy Techsponential. "That leaves the Pixel 5 again trying to differentiate itself on its camera and software."
