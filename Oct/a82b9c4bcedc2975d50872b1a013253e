Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Police are grappling to contain the fallout from the Brendin Horner murder, on a Free State farm nearly a month ago. As farmers organise themselves to protest against attacks, their workers and former staff talk about the rising tensions. Horner’s murder raised questions about the relationship between farmers and their workers, in farming towns. The 21-year-old was a farm manager and was killed near his farmhouse in Paul Roux in the Free State. READ: Tensions high in Senekal Horner’s peers in the township across the highway, say the lack of opportunities stokes resentment towards farmers. “We get the jobs at the farms. Unfortunately, the salaries are not with it. We get in early, 4am in the morning and chiala time (knock off time) is maybe 5:30pm, late afternoon," said Isaac Mafereka, a farm manager. "Then the fortnight when you get your salary it’s 60 x10, almost six hundred, a fortnight.” READ: Union accuses politicians of exploiting Senekal murder saga Mafereka says while Horner had the opportunity to improve his life, the youth in Paul Roux are relegated to being general workers. After 11 years at the farm’s distribution office, another former farmworker has nothing to show for it and he believes he's been condemned to the same fate as his mother. While residents may not be happy about being farmworkers, they don’t blame the farmers. Instead, they say government should provide the youth opportunities to develop different skills.
