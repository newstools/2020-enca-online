Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi spoke to the eNCA morning team about COVID-19's effect on education, assessments, and the rest of the academic year. Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has given Grade 1 and 8 parents one week to accept or decline placement for their children.  Lesufi has given an update on the 2021 academic calendar applications. During the briefing, the MEC said more schools should be built in the province to meet the demand. Lesufi said schools are stabilising to the new paradigm created by COVID-19. READ: Lesufi urges parents to accept school allocations "We had to put two systems in one. For example, you accelerate the test marks, your assignments, your project marks just in case we have a second wave and can't write exams, we will use that to say you have passed or you have not." Lesufi said he anticipates the curriculum will only be stabilised in two years. The MEC also raised the concern that 5 percent of learners have not yet returned to school. Lesufi was candid on the challenges of COVID-19, saying the virus exposed the inequalities that still exist in the education system.

It really brought the realities of inequalities again, to say after 27 years we thought we have moved but we haven't moved enough," the MEC said. Lesufi said the demand for new schools and school improvements has increased but has been delayed by COVID-19. He remained positive on the outlook for the placement process of pupils into schools but again urged parents to accept their school allocation to avoid delays.
