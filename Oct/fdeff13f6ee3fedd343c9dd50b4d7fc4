The fires, that began on Sunday, have destroyed many farms in Hertzogville, Hoopstad, Bultfontein and Dealesville. READ: Free State fires contained for now There have been reports of huge losses of property, livestock and game. At least one farmer has been admitted to hospital after being trapped in one of the blazes. MEC for Agriculture and Rural Development, William Bulwane said the decision to declare the areas affected by the fires will be a decision to be taken after the extent of the damage is assessed. "We are not going to declare it until our teams finalise the report, to be accurate on what damage has been caused. How many hectares, how many livestock have been affected." "Once we have all the reports, we will sit down and analyse it and then write a report to the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs because Cogta is the one who can declare a disaster."

The MEC encouraged the Free State community to support one another alongside the government's efforts to deal with the ramifications of the fires.
