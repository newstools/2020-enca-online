They claim they have received little help from the municipality. “They always say they’ll come to fix this. But they are also complaining about a manhole that’s been damaged,” said resident, Palesa Litlakanyane. "They say there’s nothing they can do until they receive the pipe they need for it to be fixed." READ: Raw sewage spills on the streets of Vaal But Emfuleni municipality says there is more to this than meets the eye. “We also have illegal structures, people who have built their own homes on top of the infrastructure,” said Emfuleni Municipality spokesperson, Stanley Gaba. "As a result, they’ve given enough weight to break the system, and that’s why the pipes you find there are always flushing back because they have collapsed." The municipality says it will continue to investigate the situation.
