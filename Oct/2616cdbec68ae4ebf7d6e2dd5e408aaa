Home Affairs gave them 30 days to explain how they came to live in South Africa.The department's issued a notice to the couple, asking them to clarify discrepancies in their applications for permanent residency.

Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Department of Home Affairs has confirmed that two senior officials, who were involved in serving religious leader Shepherd Bushiri with notices from the department, have been suspended. READ: Bushiri's SA permanent residency in question Three of the notices, sent to Bushiri and his wife Mary, were strangely withdrawn. The department is at loggerheads with the Bushiris over their fraudulent permanent residency permits. Home Affairs Minister, Aaron Motsoaledi says, while two officials were suspended for unrelated wrongdoing, there are now questions raised about their involvement in the Bushiri matter. "Bushiri and his wife entered South Africa for the first time on 6 September 2009. They were issued visitors visas. While he (Bushiri) was here in 2014, 2015 and 2016, he registered companies with the CIPC and started conducting businesses. Which is not allowed in terms of the visitors visa and immigration law." READ: Bushiri couple to remain in custody until Monday "In 2012, Mary Bushiri, the wife, entered South Africa through OR Tambo International Airport. She then produced a permanent residents visa, not a visitors visa, a permanent residents visa, which was, according to what she produced, given to her on 1 February 1997." Motsoaledi says the department will continue investigating the matter. Bushiri and his wife Mary are also facing charges of fraud, money laundering, and theft. They remain in custody until their next court appearance on Monday.
