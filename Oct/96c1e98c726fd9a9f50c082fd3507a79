Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Cape Town beachgoers are being warned not to get too close to seals. Helderberg Wildlife Rescue says seals can react to unwanted attention and attack. With visitors flocking to the beaches during summer, this disrupts the lives of their slippery residents. "A tourist actually went up to the seal and tried to take a selfie with the seal." said Rico Pentz of Helderberg Wildlife Rescue. "Sunshine did not like that, so he bit the lady on the leg, it was a pretty deep bite." The organisation says seals are also carriers of bacteria, which can cause infection and if left untreated, a person could die. * eNCA's Nobesuthu Hejana has the story.
