Sending love and strength to Naija," AKA tweeted to his 4.6 million followers. The Economic Freedom Fighters pledged its "moral and political solidarity" with Nigerians and called on the government to rein in its army and security services. "The EFF salutes the young lions of Nigeria in their resolve to graduate their successful fight against police brutality under the banner of #ENDSARS," it said in a statement. Cosatu condemned the crackdown, saying the accumulated anger of citizens over decades of failure in the delivery of basic social services and endemic corruption, was "visible in the pent-up anger, which has been boiling over in mass street protests in cities across the country". Both groups called on the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States to send a strong message to Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately end the crackdown on protesters.
