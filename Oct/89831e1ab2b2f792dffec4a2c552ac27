According to Baig, traditionally, many banks and financial institutions have had a very narrow definition of what is considered a family – usually a married couple, a married couple with kids or family members that are biologically related. However, families differ from one family unit to the other – and so, financial products need to cater for and keep up with this ever-changing family units. “We really looked at our product offering and decided to let our customers define their family structure, rather than us dictating to them” says Omar Baig, Head of Transactional Banking at the Absa Group. As South Africa and the rest of the world faced the realities and repercussions that came as byproducts of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become even more apparent that financial protection and planning can be the best way to ensure your family’s wellbeing – should you be retrenched, injured or unable to work and even after you are gone. Absa is now offering products to suit any type of family – from single parent households to blended families etc “I believe everyone has rediscovered the value of family during these tough times. At Absa we see our customers as family and want to help them prioritize and protect the financial stability of South African families,” says Baig. Absa now offers various products under the ‘Family Banking’ banner: Primary Spouse:  Secondary Spouse  Children  Seniors We also offer Bank-on-Me for free to anyone of the family members.
