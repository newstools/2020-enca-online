Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Chaos and violence, that's what leaders are worried will happen when the EFF and Afriforum descend on Senekal on Friday. The red berets will attend the court case of two suspects charged with killing 21-year-old Brendin Horner, but Afriforum is planning their own protest. Farmers in the Free State say they believe farm murders and farm attacks are fuelled by political rhetoric.

Afriforum has launched an international campaign to stop farm murders and claims there is white genocide happening in South Africa. But Free State farmers say this is not about white farmers, as many of their black colleagues are attacked or murdered all the time. When the two suspects who appeared in court for allegedly murdering Horner, angry protesters stormed the court building and set a police vehicle alight.

Farmers say, as other sections of society organise themselves, it's important for them to organise themselves into farmers' unions so they have the ability to protect themselves. There are at least seven self defence units in the towns surrounding the farms in the Free State but they are divided on whether or not to attend court on Friday.
