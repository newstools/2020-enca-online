File: Anrich Nortje bowled England's Jos Buttler, for 22, and Robin Uthappa, for 32, as Royals faltered in their chase of 162 to manage just 148 for eight in Dubai. BackpagePix DUBAI - South African quick Anrich Nortje clocked the fastest ball of the Indian Premier League at 156.22km/h and claimed two key wickets to help Delhi Capitals beat Rajasthan Royals by 13 runs on Wednesday. Nortje bowled England's Jos Buttler, for 22, and Robin Uthappa, for 32, as Royals faltered in their chase of 162 to manage just 148 for eight in Dubai. Nortje, who was ably supported by fellow Proteas paceman Kagiso Rabada, consistently bowled at over 90 mph through his four overs of fearsome pace in a match where Royals quick Jofra Archer returned figures of 3-19. "No idea I bowled at 156ks tonight but good to hear it," said man of the match Nortje. Rabada, who took one wicket to stay top of the IPL bowlers chart with 18 scalps in eight games, was all praise for his pace partner, who was picked by Delhi Capitals as a replacement for Chris Woakes ahead of the virus-hit season. "He is a real fast bowler and I can learn some technical stuff from him. I have some experience which I can tell him about," said Rabada. On Nortje hitting the fastest IPL delivery, Rabada said, "It looks like that every game. Really happy for him but not happy for the batter. When we play we only think about the delivery and not about the speed gun." Delhi skipper Shreyas Iyer made 53 and opener Shikhar Dhawan top-scored with 57 as Delhi scored 161 for seven after electing to bat first. Iyer later walked off the field after injuring his shoulder while fielding and took no further part in the match. Delhi have reclaimed top spot in the eight-team IPL table with six wins from eight games but second-placed Mumbai Indians have played just seven matches.
