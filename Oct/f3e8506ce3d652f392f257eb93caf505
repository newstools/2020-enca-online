AFP/Timothy A Clary LOS ANGELES - Borat is back, and the fictional Kazakh journalist's new film spells bad news for Holocaust deniers, Donald Trump supporters and the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. "Borat Subsequent Moviefilm," out Friday on Amazon Prime, is the sequel to Sacha Baron Cohen's 2006 smash hit, which grossed $260-million, earned an Oscar nomination and spawned endless poorly-punctuated catchphrases. Filmed in secret this summer as the United States' coronavirus lockdown eased, the follow-up again sees British comedian Baron Cohen hoodwink members of the public and politicians via his bumbling and highly offensive reporter alter-ego. READ: 'Borat' sequel coming to Amazon Prime While the plot is under wraps, word of Baron Cohen's latest outrageous ambushes has begun to spread, with Giuliani admitting in July to being set up in a fake hotel room "interview" with an attractive and flirtatious young woman. Representatives did not respond to an AFP request for comment, but Giuliani earlier told the New York Post he had thought the meeting was a serious interview about the Trump administration's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. "I only later realised it must have been Sacha Baron Cohen. I thought about all the people he previously fooled and I felt good about myself because he didn't get me," Giuliani told the publication, adding he was a "fan of some of his movies." The film's loose premise sees Borat -- disgraced by the first film's events -- offered a chance to redeem himself and his country by presenting a gift to Vice President Mike Pence, who also appears briefly in the movie.
