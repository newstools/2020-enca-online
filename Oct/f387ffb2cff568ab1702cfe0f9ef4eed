As we understand, the offenders or these individuals actually wanted to break someone out of prison to ensure that they deal with him 'themselves'. We think that is quite damaging to the criminal justice system," said department spokesperson Chrispin Phiri. Police have arrested a 52-year-old Free State farmer in connection with the protests. He is expected to face charges of malicious damage to property and public violence. Watch the video above for more details.
