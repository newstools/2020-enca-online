File: The cancellation was triggered on Saturday morning. JOHANNESBURG - South African Rugby said they are probing the death of Eastern Cape amateur player Vizicelo Zondani during an illegal tournament. Amateurs can train under strict health protocols because of the coronavirus pandemic but are barred from playing. Zondani died after sustaining an unspecified serious injury last Saturday during a tournament near King William's Town.

"Unfortunately, this goes directly against our COVID-19 guidelines... all amateur rugby matches have been suspended for the year due to the pandemic and all our unions, clubs and other bodies know this. "This tournament should never have taken place and we will launch a full investigation into the incident, as well as the tournament." Competitive top-flight and under-21 rugby resumed in South Africa this month after being suspended in March due to the pandemic. Amateurs, university students and school children are allowed to train, but not to play.
