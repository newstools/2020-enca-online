Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Members of the Moloto Concerned Group delivered a memorandum to the public protector, petitioning her to investigate the government's broken promises in delivering Moloto Corridor Projects. The upgrades were meant to ease congestion on the road that spans 160km across Gauteng, Mpumalanga and Limpopo. 60,000 commuters use the road daily.
Sam Masango from MCG said, "they confirmed themselves, to accept a memorandum. It's a one-page memorandum on simple issues: when are you starting with the Moloto Rail? Where does it start? What time? You can't fail to respond to that." Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane said the issues raised by the protestors are serious ones, including the abuse of state resources from 1996. Residents have been protesting without masks or social distancing measures saying they don't see why they should wear protective masks when they face much higher risks of death every time they commute on Moloto Road. They said the ANC suffers from tribalism which affects service delivery to certain provinces. The protestors are asking for the public protector to respond to their demands within seven days.
