AFP/Franck Fife LONDON - Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward branded the mixed messaging of the UK government "frustrating" as the impact of closed doors games showed in the English giants' latest financial figures. United posted a £23-million loss for the financial year to 30 June as revenues fell due to the coronavirus pandemic and a lack of Champions League football. Matchday revenue fell by nearly 20 percent, but there is likely to be a much steeper fall next year with no return of spectators to stadiums in England in sight. Restrictions to curb the spread of COVID-19 have been ramped up in recent weeks with Manchester one of the worst-hit areas in England. However, Woodward pointed to inconsistencies in the government guidelines that are allowing indoor entertainment to continue, while fans are shut out from football stadiums. "While we recognise public health must always be a priority, what is needed is a consistency of approach," Woodward said in a conference call with investors on Wednesday. "If people are allowed to sit in an aeroplane for hours, or in a cinema, or even watch football in a cinema, then why are they not allowed inside a stadium environment which is professionally managed and controlled? If indoor concerts are allowed, why should outdoor socially distanced football fans be treated differently? "Fans are the bedrock of this game and some of the inconsistencies out there are frustrating for them and for the clubs."
