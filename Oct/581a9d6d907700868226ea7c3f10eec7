Courtesy #DStv403 DURBAN - Private paramedics have taken their protest over non-payment to the Durban CBD. They’re allegedly owed millions. The KwaZulu-Natal Private Ambulance Association – which represents about 25 services – submitted a memorandum of demands to the Road Accident Fund (RAF). Deano Singh from the RAF said they will issue a press release at a later stage. "Needless to say we are working on your claims since we met last week and we are working tirelessly," Singh said. Normal services are expected to resume from Saturday. * eNCA’s Dasen Thathiah has the details. Watch the video above.
