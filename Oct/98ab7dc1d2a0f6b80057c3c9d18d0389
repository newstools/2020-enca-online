Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Feeling peckish? Well, Capetonians, there's a new food-delivery app on the block. It's been designed to bring community kitchens and previously inaccessible food spots to you. The app also gives a welcome boost to small businesses suffering from lockdown blues. Aptly named Pekkish SA, the app is bringing menus from lekker, local eateries in areas like Athlone, Lansdowne and Wynberg right to your door.
What's more, it's giving small businesses like these a space to grow.
The COVID-19 lockdown has had a major financial impact on many of these small eateries and so the app, which has no hidden costs or mark-ups, will hopefully help them increase their sales.* Tanya Nefdt finds out more. Watch the full video report above.
