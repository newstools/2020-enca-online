Traders and financial professionals work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). NEW YORK - US stocks posted their worst session in weeks on Monday, driven downwards by fading hopes for economic stimulus, mounting worries over the coronavirus and jitters around the November 3 elections. The major indexes recovered from the low points of the day, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average still dropped 2.3-percent to end at 27,685.38, a loss of 650 points. The broad-based S&P 500 fell 1.9-percent to close the session at 3,400.97, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index shed 1.6 percent to 11,358.94. The losses came as curfews and other restrictions in Europe to contain the resurging coronavirus raised worries about additional lockdowns in the United States, where the daily case count has hit a record. Meanwhile, policymakers in Washington continued to attempt to reach an agreement on another stimulus package, with time slipping away to get it done before election day.

Analysts are worried that reaching a deal on stimulus could be impossible even after the election if former vice-president, Joe Biden defeats President Donald Trump. "There will probably be gridlock if Biden wins but the Democrats don't take the Senate," said Gregori Volokhine of Meeschaert Financial Services. Monday's session was especially bad for sectors tied to an economic recovery, including energy, industrials and financials. Dunkin' Brands surged 16 percent after confirming it was in talks on a deal to be acquired by Inspire Brands and go private.
