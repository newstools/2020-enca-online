In 2006, 14-year-old Khwazi Magubane fled home after becoming a victim of abuse. That’s when he met his guardian angel who gave him a new lease on life. "I was turning into a criminal myself so there was a vicious cycle now of abuse and me being a naughty guy," Magubane said. "So at some point, I realised that maybe I will be better off if I became a street kid." Magubane says teacher Zinhle Hadebe's act of kindness gave him a shot at life. “When I met Kwazi a few years ago, one thing I noticed about him there was something special about that child and I saw him beyond his situation at that point," Hadebe said. "Then I asked him if he was interested in going back to school and also in getting a home and that’s how it started”. Khwazi aims to take his knowledge to the less fortunate to help them empower themselves. * Mawande Kheswa has his story. Watch the video above.
