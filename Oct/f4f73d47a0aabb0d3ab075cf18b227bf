Novak Djokovic returns the ball to Lithuania's Ricardas Berankis during their men's singles second round tennis match. PARIS -Â World number one Novak Djokovic took another confident stride closer to an 18th Grand Slam title with his 70th win at Roland Garros. Djokovic, the 2016 champion, needed just 83 minutes to complete a 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 demolition of Lithuania's Ricardas Berankis. The top seed went level with Roger Federer for victories at the tournament, although still 25 behind Rafael Nadal's all-time best. He will now face Colombian lucky loser Daniel Elahi Galan, ranked 153, for a place in the last 16. "It was difficult for Ricardas in the third set as he had an injury and couldn't move very well," said Djokovic whose afternoon stroll was eased by his opponent needing treatment on a back problem after the second set. "But I felt good just as I did in the first round and I want to continue like that." Djokovic, bidding to become the first man in half a century to win all four majors twice, also dropped only five games in his first-round match against Mikael Ymer who likened facing the Serb to a "snake killing its prey". Victory stretched his 2020 record to 33-1, his only defeat coming via disqualification from the US Open.
