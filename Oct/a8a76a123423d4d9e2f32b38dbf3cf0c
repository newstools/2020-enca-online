South African reality TV show star Shauwn Mkhize of Kwa Ma’Mkhize has been nominated for best reality TV show at the Hollywood and African Prestigious Awards. She will also be presented with the Woman of The Year Award at the same function in Beverly Hills tomorrow. JOHANNESBURG - Businesswoman, Shauwn Mkhize's, formerly Mpisane, reality show, 'KwaMam'Mkhize' has been nominated for the best reality show at the Hollywood and African Prestigious Awards. Not only that, but she will also be presented with the Woman of The Year Award at the same function in Beverly Hills on Sunday. Speaking on eNCA on Saturday, Mkhize said she was excited to have her show, which aired in predominately Zulu, nominated. Despite the show's popularity, she prefers to be known more for her business acumen. Known for controversies surrounding her business dealings, Mkhize said the reality show was a strategic business move. READ: Mpisane granted R100,000 bail "I needed to change my identity, which was tainted," she said. "I needed to ensure that I clean my house, get my things in order so that I could be seen as a proper businesswoman." Despite her attempts, Mkhize can't seem to shake her financial woes. A final liquidation order has been issued by the High Court in Pretoria, in favour of the South African Revenue Services (SARS) against one of her companies, Zikhulise Cleaning Maintenance and Transport Service. According to TimesLive, the order was brought by the revenue services for outstanding debts totaling R204 million. The company was provisionally placed under liquidation in 2018 until the court issued the final order on Wednesday. Speaking to eNCA, Mkhize brushed off the matter as something she and SARS have "reached an agreement on" in September 2019. "In any case, I've instructed my lawyers to appeal [the judgement] so that it comes to an end and that it's finalised and we're good to go again," she said.
