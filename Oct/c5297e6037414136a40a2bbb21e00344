The federation said that ever since the start of the pandemic they had worked "in constant liaison with the French government" to determine how best to stage the event. "Consequently, the FFT has made the responsible decision to hold the Rolex Paris Masters tournament behind closed doors," it said. "The FFT is aware of the disappointment people will feel at not being able to attend the tournament but would like to thank everyone for their understanding and reassure them that their tickets will be refunded as soon as possible."
