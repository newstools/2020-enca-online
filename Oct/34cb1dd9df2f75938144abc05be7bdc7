Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - A man from Heideveld on the Cape Flats is hoping his award-winning film will inspire others to protect the ocean. Shamier Magmoet won the Nature Environment Wildlife New Pitch competition last year. The R50,000 cash prize enabled him to create Rise From the Cape Flats, a short film about his life. Magmoet is the co-founder of a conservation NPO while juggling his day job as a handyman. “The hope for this film is just to make people see that no matter where you come from or what your situation is, with hard work you can rise above anything,” Magmoet said. * eNCA’s Monique Mortlock caught up with him.
