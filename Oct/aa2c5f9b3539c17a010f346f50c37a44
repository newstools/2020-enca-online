Public Servants Association President Lufuno Mulaudzi spoke to Uveka Rangappa about the organisation's view of the national strike action proposed by Cosatu. Cosatu has urged all South Africans to stay away from work on Wednesday. Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - As Cosatu prepares to embark on a nationwide strike, the Public Servants Association says it supports the union body on the issues of job losses, corruption and gender-based violence. The PSA is calling for those involved in corruption to face the law, but will not be participating in the mass action proposed by Cosatu on Wednesday. READ: Cosatu confirms national strike to go ahead on Wednesday PSA President Lufuno Mulaudzi said "the reason being that we are currently having a matter before the Labour Court about Resolution 1 of 2018." READ: PSA to fight reduction of public service wage bill "The events tomorrow are motivated by Section 77 certificate that was awarded to those who are participating tomorrow. It emanates from the joint action after parties realised there are issues in public transport, issues of job losses, corruption, OHS (occupational health and safety) and decent work. We are not part of that, tomorrow." Mulaudzi stated the PSA supports taking action against the issues raised by Cosatu in principle. "You can see the country has been held captive by corruption and nothing is happening, hence we are saying those who are involved in corruption must be dealt with by law enforcement but we see it's all talk and no action," Mulaudzi said.
