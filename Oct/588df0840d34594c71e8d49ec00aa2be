We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!," Trump tweeted. Trump earlier said he would go into quarantine after a top aide tested positive for coronavirus, in a shock development that threatened to disrupt his scheduled public appearances in the crucial final weeks of the election campaign. He confirmed in an interview with Fox News that Hope Hicks, one of his closest confidantes, had tested positive and added later on Twitter that he and First Lady Melania Trump were awaiting their own test results.

Lot of masks, she wears masks a lot but she tested positive," he added. "Then I just went out with a test. I'll see -- you know, because we spent a lot of time -- and the first lady just went out with a test also." "In the meantime, we will begin our quarantine process!" he tweeted soon after. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people stay home and isolate for up to 14 days if they might have been exposed to the virus.
