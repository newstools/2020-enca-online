READ: Kieswetter: SARS needs R800m to operate efficiently again SARS commissioner Edward Kieswetter spoke on the success of the automated assessment system. "Because of the work we have done, which included the use of third-party data and artificial intelligence, we were able to do an assessment of 3,6 million taxpayers without them having to submit a return. "I can tell you, that has been very encouraging. 1,6 million of those taxpayers have in fact already responded so almost half of them have responded and of those who have responded, just over a million of them accepted the assessment outcome that we provided for them."
