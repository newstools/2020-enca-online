Courtesy of #DStv403 DURBAN - The South Durban Community Environmental Alliance welcomed the possible closure of the Engen refinery. Reports suggest the plant will stop operating in 2023 and there's a resounding sigh of relief from the community.
Around 600 people are employed at the oil refinery which has been operating for 66 years.
It now seems the plant could be converted into a fuel storage facility for imported products. Meanwhile, the government is waiting for feedback from the engagement with all the parties.
KZN Environmental Affairs Department's spokesperson Ndabe Sibiya said they are relying on a team to engage with the Engen oil refinery. "Once they have engaged we will be in a position to indicate what are the issues and also the interventions on the part of government obviously working with civil society, the private sector including the organised labour and the community at large."
Attempts to speak to Engen were unsuccessful but in a statement, the company confirmed it was considering several options.
