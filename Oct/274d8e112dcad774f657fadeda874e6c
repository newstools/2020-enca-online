Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa in Gauteng is demanding that Premier David Makhura should consider special leave as the Special Investigating Unit continues its probe into PPE tender corruption. Denosa held a special Provincial Executive Committee meeting over developments around axed Gauteng health MEC Bandile Masuku. The union says Makhura dodged the bullet far too many times on issues relating to health in the province. READ: Masuku's work overshadowed by PPE scandal: Denosa On Friday – Makhura dismissed Bandile Masuku as health MEC following an SIU report finding that he failed to comply with the constitution. A week before that, Professor Mkhululi Lukhele resigned as Gauteng Health head, days after being suspended for PPE tender irregularities. Denosa meanwhile has rated both doctors ten out of ten on their performance. Makhura says he may reinstate Masuku if he's cleared of corruption. The axed MEC meanwhile is preparing to challenge the SIU’s report.
