The station commander of the Roodepoort police station is behind bars. Google Maps JOHANNESBURG - Two stations commanders in Gauteng have been arrested for allegedly contravening the firearms control act, fraud and defeating the ends of justice. The Western Cape Anti-Gang Unit, together with the National Anti-Corruption Unit, headed the investigation that led to their arrests. The arrests of the two brigadiers bring to 28 the total number of suspects arrested in the matter, of whom 17 are police officers and the rest civilians. Among those in custody are alleged gang bosses arrested earlier this year. The investigations started three years ago when it emerged that security companies were involved in extortion in the Western Cape. This was linked to firearm licence applications in Gauteng, which were fraudulently issued. The two station commanders will appear in the Kempton Park magistrate's court on Wednesday.
