The Eastern Cape government has withdrawn its new Information and Communication Technology plan after confirming the strategy document was plagiarised. Authorities say the only parts of the plan that weren't a direct copy of another document were the projects and location. eNCA anchor, Anlie Hattingh speaks to Mvusiwekhaya Sicwetsha, the Eastern Cape premier's spokesperson.

The Eastern Cape Premier's office, says those involved will be disciplined. But once again, the public will suffer as the ICT implementation will now be delayed. Eastern Cape premier's spokesperson, Mvusiwekhaya Sicwetsha says a new strategy will be developed. "If you're copping a document from 2015, it shows a lot of wrong things, we need to reflect in our strategies things that are addressing the developmental challenges in our province," Sicwetsha said. "We should be concerned about a lack of signal in other communities, in other rural villages, and bring this into the mainstream of ICT. "So we can't be taking what was planned for another country and think it will materialize here, we need real African solutions to African challenges."
