Tanya Nefdt reports. Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - They say art is long and life is short but, it's been a tough year for artists with many forced to cancel exhibitions and seeing a drop in sales. Now, the largest Contemporary Museum of African Art in the world, Zeitz MOCAA, is putting local artists and residents centre stage. Home is Where the Art Is, a first of its kind exhibition, is giving Capetonians a platform to showcase their work. Over 2,000 incredible artworks by collectors, professional and amateur artists were submitted. The show will run for three months, giving artists a well-deserved place to shine, especially after months of no business. * Tanya Nefdt filed this video report. Watch it above.
