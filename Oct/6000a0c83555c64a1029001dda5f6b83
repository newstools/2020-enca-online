Land claimants have been waiting for the Dido Valley Housing Project to start for more than two decades. Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - A hundred victims of apartheid-era forced removals in Simon's Town are receiving a legacy they can leave to their children and grandchildren. A local housing project is reserving 100 of its 600 subsidised units for land claimants. Most of the remaining beneficiaries of the Dido Valley Housing Project reside in town's Red Hill informal settlement. The City of Cape Town says the houses will be built on prime property, but the municipality will ensure beneficiaries aren't saddled with high rates bills. Units are expected to be completed within the next 18 months. * Watch the full video report by eNCA's Monique Mortlock in the video above.
