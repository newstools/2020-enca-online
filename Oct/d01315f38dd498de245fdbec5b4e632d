The province’s two largest hospitals, Groote Schuur and Tygerberg, have an estimated backlog of over 7,000 surgeries. But health authorities say there are already plans in place to minimise this and to ease the burden of non-COVID health conditions.

The same with those who have diabetes and cancer. Mbombo says some hospitals now have extended surgery hours while they're looking at also having operations on Saturdays to help clear the backlog.
