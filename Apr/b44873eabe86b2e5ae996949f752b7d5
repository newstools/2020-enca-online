Workers sell food and household items from their ice cream van to local residents at a supported housing estate in west Belfast. BELFAST - Ice cream vans are normally a common sight on Britain's residential streets and in parks when warmer days arrive in the spring and summer months. But with the country in lockdown because of the coronavirus, there are no customers to buy their cones, ice lollies and choc-ices. In Belfast, however, at least one van is still operating -- bringing essential supplies to the elderly and vulnerable forced to stay at home.

This year it lets the elderly and vulnerable know they will not go without potatoes, cornflakes and even hand sanitiser -- essentials needed to wait out the pandemic in safety.
