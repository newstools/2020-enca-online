COVID-19: Small scale farmers feel the pinch “This COVID-19 has affected every business person. Those in the taxi industry are also complaining about the economic impact, no one has been unaffected by COVID-19. It’s got a very negative impact.

He employs more than 150 people. “Township businesses were already struggling before COVID-19. The biggest problem right now is how they are going to recover after COVID-19.

Provincial authorities are quantifying the loss and are still finalising the economic recovery plan for once the lockdown is lifted.
