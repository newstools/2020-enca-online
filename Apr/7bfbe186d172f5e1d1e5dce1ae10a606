As of next month, disability and pension grants will be paid from the 4th day of the month while all other grants will be paid from the 6th of every month. Sassa says lessons learnt from the last payment cycle during the national lockdown have compelled it to review the payment dates.

"There is no need to rush to withdraw cash on the first day we deposit it into your account. "The Sassa card can be used as a debit card to pay for purchases, therefore it is not necessary to withdraw cash and thereafter purchase goods with the cash.” READ: COVID-19 death toll rises to 13, confirmed cases to 1,749 - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
