Premier David Makhura says these are new beds in both the public and private sector. He was speaking after taking President Cyril Ramaphosa on a walkabout of a hall at the Nasrec Expo Centre. The hall has been demarcated as a quarantine and isolation facility for coronavirus patients. These are part of the 500 new beds placed inside a hall at the centre. The Gauteng government’s aim is eventually to have 2200 beds at this unit. READ: 28 Gauteng health officials test positive for COVID-19 President Cyril Ramaphosa has praised Gauteng's preparations. The president also visited the Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital. The hospital used to have 12 ICU units. It now has 100. The premier says the coronavirus has forced government to fast track some of its plans to improve public health. “We are preparing for whatever may happen. We don’t want to be complacent or say that we are fully ready. Every day we are building additional capacity. This has been the epicenter and we don’t want to take anything for granted," said Makhura.
