Some Johannesburg metro police officers are claiming they are being forced to work without protective gear. JOHANNESBURG - The Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) has apologised on Monday for leaving some officers without PPE and for a payroll error shorting many of their members. JMPD officers said they were told to buy their own masks and gloves to protect themselves while carrying out their duties enforcing compliance with national lockdown regulations. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar admitted that the metro police were not prepared at the beginning of the outbreak and the distribution of PPE was not coordinated properly. Minnaar said the department has subsequently received 2,500 masks and will receive additional supplies on Monday.
