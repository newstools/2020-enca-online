File: US President Donald Trump charged the WHO with being "very China-centric" despite Washington's heavy funding. BEIJING - China announced it will give another $30-million to the World Health Organization to help in the global fight against the coronavirus pandemic, days after Washington said it would freeze funding. The US, which is the WHO's biggest contributor, accused the organisation last week of "mismanaging" the COVID-19 crisis, drawing ire from Beijing as both countries spar over the deadly virus. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the new donation would be in addition to a previous $20-million committed and would help "strengthen developing countries' health systems".

In announcing the funding freeze last week, US President Donald Trump accused the WHO of covering up the seriousness of the coronavirus outbreak in China before it spread. He has also charged the WHO with being "very China-centric" despite Washington's heavy funding. Explainer: What Donald Trump's funding cuts to WHO mean for the world According to Trump, US taxpayers provided between $400-million and $500-million per year to the WHO, while "in contrast, China contributes roughly $40 million a year and even less". Trump also claimed the outbreak could have been contained with "very little death" had the WHO assessed the situation in China accurately. The deadly virus, which has claimed more than 181,000 lives worldwide, first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, which was locked down in late January to curb the spread. Beijing has urged the US to support WHO-led international action against the pandemic after it halted funding, while observers warned that the US freeze would have consequences for the WHO's other disease control programmes around the world.
