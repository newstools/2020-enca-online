"The second point is that the lockdown doe not in any way encourage people to invade land illegally. So, anybody who invades during the lockdown, we move in we prevent it, we arrest them. "There’s a difference between evictions and countering land invasions, so this is important. There will be no evictions. The meeting of the mayors with the provincial government has affirmed there will never be evictions in Gauteng but if there are people invading, we must act on them."
