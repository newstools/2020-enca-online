Danielle Bitton is sharing her gift of song with her neighbours and honouring the healthworkers who have assisted her through her cancer treatment and are working with those infected with COVID-19. CAPE TOWN - A South African performer is not letting cancer -- or the national lockdown -- stop her from spreading joy to others. Danielle Bitton is using her singing talent to lift her neighbours' spirits while paying tribute to essential workers in what's become an 8pm ritual the world over. My first Quarantine/Lockdown performance to my neighbours in Sea Point from my balcony on Friday night. for full video visit my YouTube and Please Subscribe <Link in my bio> I had so much fun I decided to do it again the following night, with a bigger setup 🤗 see my next video. A post shared by  DanielleBitton1 (@daniellebitton1) on Apr 12, 2020 at 9:12am PDT Bitton’s career was cut short by a diagnosis of Stage 2 breast cancer and she had to return home for treatment. She not only has to go through chemotherapy but is doing so on her own because of the lockdown. Despite her challenges, Bitton is using her talent to entertain her neighbours from her balcony. She explained, "I love to sing and it makes me so happy and I hadn’t sung in so long and really just wanted to share it with my neighbours." Last night was everything, it was so wonderful to sing again and have the privilege of performing for my neighbourhood Sea Point, Cape Town and honouring our front line workers that are working around the clock for us. This song is very special to me, I used to sing it with my late father, and haven't sang it in over 10 years. it is a song of hope, of faith that we can overcome anything if we just believe. I know I am going to beat this and I know as a nation we will overcome this too, and I pray we come out of it kinder, more compassionate and loving towards one another 💗 SEE THE FULL LIVE SHOW ON MY YOUTUBE <LINK IN BIO> www.youtube.com/divadlb and please Subscribe 🙏🏼 Share and spread the Light, Love & Hope during these trying times  #Seapointserenadesessions #seapointserenade  #BeatingCancer #Brestcancerawareness #Balconyboogie #WarriorWoman  #lockdown  #ChemoandCorona #livemusic #whenyoubelieve #hallelujah #seapoint #capetown #atlanticseaboard #spreadlove #love #spreadlight #light #spreadhope #hope #singtogether #united #proudlysouthafrican #coronavirus #covid19 #dontcryformequarentina #iwillsurvive #surviveandthrive A post shared by  DanielleBitton1 (@daniellebitton1) on Apr 12, 2020 at 9:12am PDT "There are going to be more concerts, three more, on the 24, 25 and 30th last day of lockdown and even if you don’t live in my neighbourhood, you can log on to howler.co.za/balconysessions because we’ll be streaming live."
