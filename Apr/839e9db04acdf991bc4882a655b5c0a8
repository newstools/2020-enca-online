Beachgoers enjoy their first swim after Bondi Beach reopened following a five-week closure in Sydney. SYDNEY - Hundreds of Sydney-siders rushed into the waves at the city's famous Bondi Beach on Tuesday as Australia took the first steps in easing coronavirus restrictions. Dozens of eager surfers jumped railings and hit the water even before the beach officially opened at 7am, five weeks after police sealed the area off because of large crowds ignoring social distancing orders. More ruly swimmers and boarders lined up patiently and cheered as council workers moved fences aside to allow them through. Although there were large numbers in the sea, the sand remained largely empty as people are still barred from sunbathing or gathering on the shore.

The reopening of Bondi and a couple of neighbouring beaches came as several of Australia's states began slowly easing restrictions on public gatherings, spurred by a slowing of confirmed coronavirus cases around the country. Despite the early fence-hoppers, most people at Bondi Beach appeared to be embracing the added freedoms while sticking to distancing guidelines. Australia has confirmed some 6,700 cases of COVID-19, with 84 deaths for a population of about 25 million. There have been fewer than 20 new cases of the disease per day over the past week.
