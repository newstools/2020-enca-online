Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Over 900 people in South Africa who tested positive for the coronavirus have recovered but those who have survived the disease, now face a stigma battle. Testing positive for COVID-19 is one of the worst nightmares health workers face right now. Doctor Elana Landman says the hospital she works at acted quickly, tracing those who came into contact with her but, she says it was easier fighting the virus, than the stigma of having contracted the disease in the first place.

Another person who is struggling to shake the stigma of having contracted COVID-19 is Buli Malaza. She says she was mistreated and she's also still traumatised from being ill.

With over 900 recoveries in South Africa, these two are likely not the only ones fighting to be reintegrated back into a society that's wary of them. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
