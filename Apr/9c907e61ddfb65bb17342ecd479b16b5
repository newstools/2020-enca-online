COVID-19 quarantine sites have been set up at South Africa’s gold mines. That's as the industry is preparing to reopen while bracing for infections. Open Cast mining will be allowed to return to full production while the gold and platinum mines will run at up to 50-percent capacity. READ: Mines to operate at 50% capacity during lockdown Mines like Sibanye Gold is preparing to re-open by transforming their arrival process but they’re also required to prepare to contain a potential outbreak. The company has converted its single-sex hostels for this purpose. Sibanye says resuming operations is a risk, but the company is well prepared. The return to work for Sibanye employees is being closely managed and if this cautious reopening works, it may set the bar for South Africa's big industries.
