JOHANNESBURG - You've got to hand it to South Africans: We certainly know how to make light of a serious situation. At the end of his address on ThursdayÂ night, President Cyril Ramaphosa thought it would be a good idea to put on a mask. But our Number One struggled to get it on, and it didn't take long for the memes to appear. The president has been compared to the Mask and as Fifty Shades of Grey fans called it, Fifty Shades of Lockdown. Netflix movie Bird Box was also mentioned. Only real heroes wear masks, and South Africans reckon Ramaphosa's one of them.
