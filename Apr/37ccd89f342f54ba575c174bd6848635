Many hotels are feeling the pinch but, some are managing to stay afloat, by helping in the fight against the coronavirus. In South Africa, tourism is also being battered by COVID-19. There are one or two establishments that have been allowed to operate because they're being used as places for essential workers to self-isolate.
