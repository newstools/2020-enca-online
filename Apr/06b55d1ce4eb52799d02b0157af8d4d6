Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) is angered by gold producer Village Main Reef for issuing a warning notice to staff that the Tau Lekoa Mine could be closed permanently. Mine management reportedly told staff not to report for work after the lockdown ends. "They are making more excuses on closing down and rescaling of the mines, of which we disagree as the National Union of Mineworkers to all the decisions that they are making," said NUM spokesperson Masibulele Naki. READ: NUM says mines still operational, against lockdown controls "We were having many meetings since last year making means of how we can actually improve on their production scale and up to now they were doing very well and now they are being opportunistic." He says the mine did not consult the union before instituting processes. "We wrote to them and told them that we disagree with the whole process of Section 197, which was not consulted with NUM and Section 187, which was also not consulted too,"Â he added.
