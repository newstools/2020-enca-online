NEW YORK - Boeing unveiled a voluntary worker layoff programme, telling employees that it hoped to avoid "other workforce actions" as the aviation industry reels from the coronavirus crisis. The initiative was announced by Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun, who said such belt-tightening was needed amid the hit to the industry caused by the pandemic. "It's important that we start adjusting to our new reality now," he said.

But the COVID-19 crisis has made Boeing's situation significantly worse, grounding most commercial airline travel and putting major carriers in a life-or-death fight to go forward. "When the world emerges from the pandemic, the size of the commercial market and the types of products and services our customers want and need will likely be different," Calhoun said.

Calhoun said the company would have additional information on the program in three to four weeks. A Boeing official said the company expects "several thousand employees to take the voluntary layoff package or retire," adding that the company would continue to recruit in some targeted areas, including for defense and space programs. Workers would exit Boeing permanently and would generally receive a pay and benefits package that includes a period of partially-subsidised healthcare coverage.
