Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - More than half a million jobs could be lost in Gauteng alone. That's the word from Premier David Makhura. He was briefing the media on the state of the province, during the coronavirus pandemic. Makhura says as a worst-case scenario, between 500,000 and 600,000 jobs could be lost in Gauteng. He says as a best-case scenario around 250,000 jobs could be lost. "We looked at the best-case scenario, even in the best-case scenario there will be jobs lost. So in the best-case scenario for our provincial economy, there will be 250,000 jobs lost and we say to you that is the best-case scenario. The best-case scenario is also not good in itself and the reality is that job losses are inevitable", said Makhura.
