The lineup of characters available to express feelings in the social network will be expanded next week to include a well-known round yellow cartoon face with arms that gently embrace a red heart. The move to express "care" adds to the existing emojis including the well-known "like" button and more recent icons to express love, laughter, sadness, anger and awe.
