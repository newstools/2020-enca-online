NEW YORK - This is TikTok's time. The social video platform which was already a favorite of teens is increasingly being used by adults looking for ways to pass the time during coronavirus lockdowns. Users post short videos -- no longer than 60 seconds but often as short as 15 -- to showcase their bite-size dance skills or share relatable experiences with a humorous twist. The application, owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, saw 65 million worldwide downloads in March, according to analytics site SensorTower.

Celebrities have joined the fun too, from Jennifer Lopez to Mariah Carey -- even 82-year-old Jane Fonda. The site has also taken on the role of promoting stay-at-home content in an effort to help fight the virus, a TikTok spokeswoman said. The hashtag #happyathome has seen more than 7.9 billion views. "We're committed to doing our part to help the broader community get through this difficult time," she said.
