File: Much of the rest of rapper Kanye West's wealth comes from real estate he owns, the magazine said. WASHINGTON - Rapper Kanye West is now a billionaire thanks largely to the basketball shoes bearing his name that he developed with Adidas, Forbes magazine said. The rough figure of the wealth of Kim Kardashian's hubby is $1.3-billion, the magazine said in announcing the musician is now on its list of people worth at least $1-billion. The 42-year-old, Chicago-born rapper's Yeezy footwear often sells for more than $200 a pair in the United States and elsewhere.
