Limpopo Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba wants more medical personnel to be deployed in the province to fight the coronavirus. Limpopo is one of the provinces that has the lowest number of cases at 19, so far. Ramathuba speaks to eNCA. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Limpopo Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba says she is concerned the province doesn't have enough resources to combat COVID-19. The province currently has 19 confirmed cases. Most cases are said to have been brought by people travelling from other areas. "As a rural province we are seeing that prior the lockdown our numbers were very low, we were around 6, but after everyone returned from urban areas, our numbers, as I speak now, are at 19. READ: SA to rollout mass screening for coronavirus It's gonna be difficult as a resource constraint province to win the battle against COVID-19 in a hospital setting or ICU. I'd be lying if I said I have the resources and that is why we need as many professionals as possible to be deployed on the ground", said Ramathuba. She warned that the situation could be dire if testing is not done thoroughly. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
