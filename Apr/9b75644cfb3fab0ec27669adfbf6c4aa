The Olympic Flame is displayed at the J-Village National Training Centre after the handover ceremony of the lantern containing the Olympic Flame. FUKUSHIMA - Tokyo 2020 organisers left the Olympic flame in the hands of Fukushima Prefecture on Wednesday where it will be on display in a lantern for the next month after the Games were postponed for a year due to the coronavirus outbreak. The handover took place at a subdued ceremony at the J-Village National Training Centre in Fukushima, which was originally set to be the starting point of the torch relay. Only Tokyo 2020 COO Yukihiko Nunomura made the trip north from the organising committee.

He then handed the Olympic flame to Makoto Noji from the Fukushima government. "I strongly believe that the Olympic flame departure from the J-Village next year will be a strong message that we can overcome whatever difficulty,” said Noji. “(It is a) symbol of hope - after we overcome this coronavirus disease we are now facing, with the people, not only from Japan, but from all over the world.” READ: Tokyo Olympic Games postponed The flame will stay on display in the J-Village until April 30 before being moved to Tokyo. Organisers have not yet decided where in the Japanese capital it will be displayed. The International Olympic Committee and Japanese government succumbed to intense pressure from athletes and sporting bodies around the world last week by agreeing to push back the Games because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Tokyo Olympics will now run from 23 July to 8 August 2021.
