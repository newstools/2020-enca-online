 VATICAN CITY - Pope Francis will break with centuries of tradition and livestream Easter Sunday mass to allow the world's 1.3 billion Catholics to celebrate their holiest holiday under a coronavirus lockdown. Even such hallowed traditions as the pope's messages to the faithful on Saint Peter's Square have been replaced by prayers that Francis reads into a camera from the seclusion of his private library. His only audience is the camera and the 83-year-old Argentine has admitted that the entire experience makes him feel "caged".

It had taken place around the Roman Colosseum in the presence of at least 20,000 faithful for more than 50 years. But Rome and the rest of Italy have been living under forced confinement since early March.

The Vatican's entrance is now sealed off by armed police wearing facemasks and rubber gloves. The pope has openly admitted that he was struggling along with everyone else to make sense of these extraordinary times. "We have to respond to our confinement with all our creativity," Francis said in an interview published by several Catholic newspapers this week. "We can either get depressed and alienated ... or we can get creative."
