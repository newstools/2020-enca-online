A young chef is desperate after she was kicked out of a COVID-19 quarantine site. Olwethu Maseko is from Cape Town but is stuck in Gauteng due to lockdown regulations. Now, she's in limbo because authorities have no plans to help her leave. eNCA's Nqobile Madlala reports. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Olwethu Maseko arrived in South Africa on 26 March following an internship in the United States. When Maseko returned, she and others were sent to a hotel east of Johannesburg and placed under quarantine. Two weeks later she was told to leave but with planes grounded and inter-provincial travel restricted due to the lockdown, she can't return home to Cape Town. "The nurses that went in and out every day to check on us, they told us we need to fend for ourselves," Maseko said. WATCH: The stigma of surviving COVID-19 In desperation, she turned to Facebook, asking people she's never met for help. Luckily, one woman came to her rescue and Olwethu's now staying with her but, it's a temporary situation. The Gauteng Health Department says it will look into Maseko's situation. In the meantime, she is stuck a thousand kilometres away from home.
