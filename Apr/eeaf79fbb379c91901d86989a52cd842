In Madagascar, 25 people were sentenced on the spot and forced to sweep the capital's dusty streets. ANTANANARIVO - Madagascar police forced citizens caught outside without a coronavirus face mask to sweep pavements on Monday, law enforcement officials said. President Andry Rajoelina has made it compulsory to wear face coverings outdoors in the capital Antananarivo, as well as in the cities of Fianarantsoa and Toamasina, to curb the spread of coronavirus. The new rule, which came into force on Monday, was announced on April 20 alongside the gradual lifting of lockdown measures in the three main cities.

"Seventy percent of people on the street respected the rule... because they are scared of having to sweep pavements," the head of anti-coronavirus operations, general Elak Olivier Andriakaja, said on state television. "Measures were taken before the sanctions fell into place to raise awareness and distribute mouth covers," Andriakaja added. "I think that's enough and that sanctions must now be applied."
