Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng acting social development MEC Panyaza Lesufi visited the home of the pensioner who died earlier this week. Ellen Mbhele passed away before she could receive her Sassa grant. Her family says they are deeply saddened by her passing. WATCH: Pensioners stuck in queues as Sassa pays out grants They, however, say her death was not a result of negligence. “She collapsed on her way to the pension paypoint. She was on her way where they collect their grants at the Post Office," said her niece Phumzile Kheswa. "This did not happen because of the long queues, it did not happen because of negligence caused by anyone. It was time.” READ: Sassa grant payouts run smoother on Day 2 Lesufi says the department will do all it can to support the family.
