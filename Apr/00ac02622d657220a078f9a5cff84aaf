Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Life under lockdown regulations is far from over. South Africans can expect some rules to stay, even after the five-week-long official lockdown ends. Cooperative Governance Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has told Parliament there will be "chaos" if the lockdown is lifted completely. She’s also explained the rationale for the contentious ban on the sale of hot food. Explainer: New amendments to the lockdown regulations Drinkers and smokers are among those anxiously waiting for the lockdown to end. Dlamini-Zuma says life as we know it, cannot resume immediately. She says the recent ban on the sale of hot food is intended to stop the unnecessary movement of people. Lockdown: 'Some regulations will remain in place for a long time' Dlamini-Zuma says limits on large gatherings, church services and funerals will remain. “So there will come a time when all funerals will be treated in the same way. "That’s why funerals are limited because they do encourage the spread of the virus, the same as the schools,” she added. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
