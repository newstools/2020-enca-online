"People are still taking chances, not realising the seriousness of this virus,"  Naidoo said. "For now, I don't think they can have any reasonable explanation for continuing with that wedding. We will be interviewing each one individually. "The charges will be put to them, they have definitely contravened the regulations of the Disaster Management Act. "The prosecutor will guide us on exactly which charges will be preferred against them. I don't think we can be expecting any explanation from them at this point in time unless we have spoken to the senior prosecutor."
