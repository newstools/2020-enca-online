Lesotho soldiers are seen on the streets of Maseru enforcing the lockdown ordered by Prime Minister Thomas Thabane. MASERU - Lesotho's minister of police and public safety is under investigation after a video of him buying alcohol and flouting lockdown regulations went viral, a police source said. The sale and purchase of alcohol is prohibited in Lesotho which is observing a nationwide 24-day lockdown starting from March 29. But CCTV footage from outside a liquor warehouse showed police minister, Lehlohonolo Moramotse, collecting boxes of alcohol and loading them into a car. "Police are investigating this matter," a senior police source told AFP. "Investigations are at a very advanced stage." However, police spokesman Mpiti Mopeli said he was not aware of any investigations.
