File: The new schedule will prevent a direct conflict between any of these major events and will ensure athletes can compete in up to three world-class competitions. PARIS - The world athletics championships originally scheduled for next year in Eugene, Oregon, will take place from 15 to 24 July 2022, avoiding a potential clash with the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. World Athletics last month shifted the event to 2022 to accommodate the rearranged Tokyo Olympics, which were postponed by a year due to the coronavirus pandemic. "The World Athletics Council approved the new dates this week after extensive discussions with the sport's stakeholders including organisers of two other major championships due to take place in July-August 2022, the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games and the multisport European Championships in Munich," World Athletics said in a statement.
