The club decided to end its relationship with technology company IN2 IT which has been awarded a controversial tender by the Gauteng government. Gauteng Premier David Makhura has intervened, ordering an investigation. IN2 IT Technology has been in partnership with Swallows since July last year.

After years of struggling, Swallows are on the verge of returning to top-flight football and the loss of a sponsor could not have come at the most critical time. "We planned around three-years with the sponsor, so there is no plan in place the only thing that we can do now is to go open our piggy banks and make sure that the team stays ahead and we don’t suffer any setbacks,” Mogashoa said. Swallows could be on a path to a better financial position, should the league campaign resume and they gain promotion to the ABSA Premiership but with the lockdown, that’s still up in the air.
