AMSTERDAM - While the world waits for a coronavirus vaccine, medicines used to deal with the symptoms of the disease are increasingly in critically short supply in Europe, the worst-hit continent. From sedatives needed to intubate patients struggling to breathe to anti-malarial drugs heavily backed by US President Donald Trump, the COVID-19 pandemic is eating up stocks. The European Medicines Agency said that the "continued availability of medicines, in particular those used for patients with COVID-19, is of critical concern for EMA".

Doctors in Italy, the country hardest-hit by the virus, also warned last week that limited stocks of the two drugs could wreck plans to use them in clinical trials. Similar concerns have been raised about a combination of two HIV drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir.
