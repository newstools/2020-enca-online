Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - The owners of a dog that was allegedly shot dead by a soldier say they want answers from the SANDF. Bonzo died after sustaining a gunshot wound in Parkwood in Cape Town. The Cape of Good Hope SPCA has investigated the incident and says the dog was shot by a soldier during a lockdown operation. READ: Jogging, walking your dog allowed during lockdown Stanley and Chrystolene Johannes say they were standing at this window on 30 March, watching soldiers patrolling. The shocked couple watched how Bonzo was shot, allegedly by a soldier. He'd been their pet for 12 years. WATCH: The role of SANDF during lockdown The SANDF issued a statement, claiming the video is “fake news” and that it happened in September last year. But an autopsy revealed Bonzo had recently died from a gunshot wound and the NGO’s probe claims the dog was killed by a soldier. “Our concern is that more animals will suffer as the result of the militant style that is applied by the military. So in this instance, we’ve seen an animal suffered as a result of their militant tactics that they were using. So we just want a peaceful, calm operation to take place,” said Jaco Pieterse of the Cape of Good Hope SPCA. The SANDF has yet to reply to eNCA's request for comment.
