Many industries are hanging by a thread during the lockdown but not the textile sector. The National Bargaining Council for Clothing Manufacturing Industry says it can make 100-million face masks per month. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The textile industry is getting its needles and threads ready as it is set to produce 100 million face masks for South Africans per month. A total of 141 companies will be stitching these masks together. WATCH: Masks can protect against COVID-19 Under the new rules, South Africans will be compelled to wear facemasks in public. The Southern African Clothing and Textile Workers' Union says the coronavirus outbreak and subsequent lockdown have dented the industry, so, it's welcoming the 100 million mask task.
