Financial trouble, board divisions and calls for reform had become commonplace at Sascoc. JOHANNESBURG - The latest dispute involving Olympic body Sascoc has thrown the organisation into even more chaos. Acting president Barry Hendricks is contesting his suspension amid the uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Hendricks has dismissed one of the two investigations he is under. He has also slammed what he called the non-existent Sascoc Judicial Body which has been asked to look into claims that he interfered in the nominations process. READ: Sascoc suspends acting president “Forced leave of absence is a suspension. Let’s not jump around what it actually meant. It meant that I was forced to step down," said Hendricks. "I disagreed with it, and I still regard myself as the legitimate acting president of Sascoc.” Hendricks has been at the helm of Sascoc since Gideon Sam’s retirement in December. Financial trouble, board divisions and calls for reform -- which have been endorsed by the Sports Ministry -- had become commonplace.

Hendricks has clearly lost faith in the current board. “Because it is now very clear that with this sort of action being taken, there is no hope for the Sascoc board, that despite our attempts at mediation, at dialogue," he said.

I can’t see Sascoc operating in that time of environment.” Hendricks maintains his innocence in the election process.
