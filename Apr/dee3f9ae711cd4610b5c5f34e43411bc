File: Johnny Clegg's family said it "strongly" objected to the use of his music for shark cage diving because it would be contrary to his values. PORT ELIZABETH - Johnny Clegg's family has barred a South African shark cage-diving operator from using the late legendary singer's music to lure the predators for deep-sea viewing excursions, his manager said. Raggy Charters had wanted to lower underwater speakers playing Cleggs's music to attract white sharks in the southern Algoa Bay to "give the whole operation an African touch," owner Lloyd Edwards told AFP. But Clegg's family said it "strongly" objected to the use of his music for shark cage diving because it would be contrary to his values.

"Johnny would have hated to lure any kind of wildlife into any condition that wasn't natural," Clegg's manager Roddy Quin told AFP. "And if they were going to use his music to lure sharks into certain areas, he would have been very unhappy with that because he would never interfere with any kind of wildlife in their natural habitat whatsoever," Quin said.

Edwards told AFP that he respected the family's wishes and would use alternative music. "We thought we would give the whole thing a South African touch and flavour," Edwards said. Music is commonly used to bring sharks nearer to cages for tourists to have a closer look. Operators in Australia use music from heavy metal groups like AC/DC to lure sharks.
