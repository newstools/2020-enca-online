Ying Ying and Le Le have only really had each other for company since lockdowns shut off the flow of guests to their theme park pad. HONG KONG - Stuck at home with no visitors and not much else to do, a pair of pandas in Hong Kong finally decided to give mating a go after a decade of dodging the issue. Like half the planet, Ying Ying and Le Le have only really had each other for company since coronavirus-caused lockdowns shut off the flow of guests to their theme park pad. And like couples everywhere, they've been making the best of the time on their own.

The park released photos of the pair embracing in an enclosure uncharacteristically free from prying eyes and cameraphones. Pandas are notoriously bad at reproducing, especially in captivity. But vets had their hopes up when the monochromatic lovers started showing an interest in each other during the short spring mating season. For those who knew where to look for the tell-tale signs, ursine love was in the air.

"Such behaviours are consistent with those common during breeding season, which occurs once every year between March to May," it added. Experts will now monitor Ying Ying for signs of pregnancy, but it may be quite some wait as the gestation period for giant pandas ranges from 72 to 324 days.
