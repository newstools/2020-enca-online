READ: Western Cape mass screening, testing in full swing At the peak of COVID-19, the Western Cape anticipates there will be around 80,000 infections in the province. 90 percent of those carrying the virus will be expected to recover at home. “We are now moving into the realm where people are starting to be infected that does not have that luxury of being able to isolate and quarantine at home,” said Western Cape Health Department head Dr Keith Cloete. READ: Western Cape preparing for COVID-19 infection spike The province currently has 14,000 healthcare workers with 47 of them already showing symptoms of the virus. Winde has called for society to show more support to those infected. About 3,000 COVID-19 tests are conducted daily in the Western Cape with that number expected to increase by at least a thousand by the end of the month. In total, 222 people in the province have recovered from the virus, giving some hope that this is an enemy that can be beaten.
