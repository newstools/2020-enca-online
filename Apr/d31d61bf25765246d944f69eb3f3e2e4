Courtesy #DStv403 Having come from humble beginnings and growing up in the village of Bergville in Kwa Zulu Natal, Zanele Van Zyl has successfully managed to turn her passion into a career. As a young girl, she grew up watching her mother cook soulful traditional food. It was only after she met her husband who challenged her in the kitchen with his cooking skills that she discovered her passion and talent in culinary arts. She was then inspired to study and qualify as a professional chef. Her tenacity and entrepreneurial nature led her to start the “Cooking With Zanele” classes where she teaches and shares her passion for food with keen foodies in different kitchens across the country. She makes cooking delicious beautiful food less daunting by demonstrating her creative, quick and easy recipes in a fun learning environment. Over the years the Zanele has built and inspired a community of foodies through her cooking classes, social media platforms, and now her self-published cookbook (Cooking with Zanele – Simple, Delicious, Quick Meals) that has been well received by her followers. Cooking With Zanele has become a recognizable brand that influences dinner decisions and inspires busy homemakers to experiment in the kitchen and elevate the quality of food they serve to their family and friends.
