The Tokyo Paralympics will now run from 24 August to 5 September 2021. TOKYO - After the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Games following the coronavirus outbreak, Paralympics chief Andrew Parsons is focused on consolidating losses and protecting smaller national federations stung by the change. The decision was made last month to postpone the Games until the summer of 2021 because of the impact of COVID-19, which has so far killed over 81,000 people worldwide.

It has left the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) with a cashflow issue as broadcasters and other partners look to defer planned payments until next year. Parsons did not clarify how much money was on the line but stressed that he hasn't turned to the International Olympic Committee for support.

In turn, Parsons and the IPC wanted to rearrange commitments made by themselves and various national committees this summer. “Cancelled events and changed plans come at a cost to our members, who are normally not big and rich organisations. So, they are not immune to the financial problems that come with COVID-19,” explained Parsons.
