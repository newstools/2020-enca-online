A post shared by  Leonardo DiCaprio (@leonardodicaprio) on Apr 15, 2020 at 5:44am PDT LOS ANGELES - Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro have rallied fellow Hollywood A-listers in a new coronavirus fundraising campaign by offering a walk-on role in their upcoming film to one lucky donor. The actors are set to star in "Killers of the Flower Moon," one of next year's most hotly anticipated movies, which is directed by Martin Scorsese and tells the true story of Native American killings in 1920s Oklahoma. "If you ever wondered what it was like to be able to work with the great Martin Scorsese, this is your chance," said DiCaprio in an Instagram video.

The initiative is part of the #AllInChallenge, which sees celebrities including movie and sport stars auction or donate a "once-in-a-lifetime fan experience," and challenge others to do the same. Opportunities to have Justin Bieber fly to your house for a private show, watch a Los Angeles Lakers basketball game ringside with Magic Johnson, or play golf with Rob Lowe have collectively raised $4-million so far. Organisers hope to raise $100-million.
