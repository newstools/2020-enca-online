Lesotho's Prime Minister Tom has been under pressure to resign. MASERU - Lesotho's government has agreed with South African mediators and political parties to implement a "dignified retirement" for prime minister Tom Thabane. Thabane has been under pressure to resign, owing to a murder case in which he and his current wife are suspected of assassinating his previous wife, charges which both of them deny. "The coalition government of the Kingdom of Lesotho commits to effecting the implementation process or modalities for the dignified, graceful and secure retirement of the right honourable prime minister," a joint statement said.

"There are one or two issues that need to be traversed in order to ensure that all political parties are of the same mind in terms of speeding up that parliamentary process," he added. Thabane's spokesman Relebohile Moyeye said by telephone that Thabane would respond to the statement on Tuesday.
