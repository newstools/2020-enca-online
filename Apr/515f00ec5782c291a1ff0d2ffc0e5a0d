But trade union Solidarity wants government to listen to its plan and try and save the airline in some shape or form. “Solidarity already started discussions with the BRPs and government to see whether there is a chance to see if we can save certain elements and parts to protect workers that were not at fault,” said Solidarity's Dirk Hermann.
