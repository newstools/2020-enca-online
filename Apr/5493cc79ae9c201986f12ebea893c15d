The COVID-19 national lockdown is in full effect and it has been weeks since Eskom has implemented load-shedding. The power utility says it is experiencing a reduction in demand for electricity. It says this has provided an opportunity to carry out required short-term maintenance. eNCA speaks to Eskom CEO, Andre de Ruyter. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Eskom CEO Andre de Ruyter says it will take a lot longer to fix the damage done by 10 years of capture and corruption. The embattled power utility has been struggling for a long time to keep South Africa's lights on. Since President Cyril Ramaphosa's national lockdown announcement, the country has not experienced any load-shedding. Eskom says it is using this time of decreased electricity demand, due to the lockdown, to perform critical short-term maintenance. SA Lockdown: Eskom doubles maintenance due to low demand "We think we will be able to emerge from this lockdown period with a fleet in which we have better reliability and predictability. Having said that, we still have a lot of work to do to catch up with 10 years of neglect that needs to be repaired", he said. Eskom has said it does not expect to implement load-shedding for the duration of the national lockdown.
