Courtesy #DStv403 My name is Haseena. I’m an Occupational therapist by profession and enjoy working with children.  I was never a person who enjoyed being in the kitchen but being a mom of 3 I found that I needed to make meals and dishes that my children enjoyed whilst being easy to cook.  I started my page @the_daily_dilemna to share with others the fact that cooking and baking are actually easy, fun and very much therepeutic. One does not need to spend hours in the kitchen in order to make a healthy and nutritious meal. When I’m not busy cooking up a storm or working,  I’m busy being a mom, a chauffeur, a tutor and sometimes even a referee!! The best time of day for me is coffee time and I look forward to sitting down with a good, strong coffee whilst reading a book, scrolling through Instagram or catching up on any Netflix series I’m following.  I try to stay healthy by going to gym a few times a week (I try!!) and I enjoy spending time with my family either going out to a fun place for the children or even just going out for a meal and ice cream.  I enjoy travelling with my family and exploring new cities and countries.
