File: The cancellation of Wimbledon leaves the tennis season in disarray. LONDON - Tennis may not return until 2021 after the coronavirus pandemic caused the cancellation of the entire grasscourt season and most of the claycourt campaign, All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) chief executive Richard Lewis said on Thursday. The outbreak has played havoc with the global sporting calendar and the Wimbledon Championships were cancelled by the AELTC on Wednesday for the first time since the Second World War.

"The optimist in me – and I'm often not optimistic – still hopes that the American hardcourt season will take place," Lewis said. "One hopes that things have settled down a bit and those big 1,000-point tournaments -- Montreal, Toronto, Cincinnati -- can happen in the lead-up to the US Open. We all know that's probably tenuous at the moment.

But let's hope that the US Open and Roland Garros can take place." The French Open, originally due to be played from May 24 to June 7, was postponed and controversially rescheduled by the French tennis federation for September 20 to October 4 -- a week after the US Open concludes.
