A Kenyan police officer explains social distancing measures that have to be followed to a group of people in Nairobi. NAIROBI - Kenya's president apologised for violence meted out by police following the declaration of a nationwide curfew last week to curb the spread of coronavirus. "I want to apologise to all Kenyans for... some excesses that were conducted," President Uhuru Kenyatta said in a live broadcast from State House, during which he also introduced two young Kenyan coronavirus survivors. "But I want to assure you that if we work together, if we all understand that this problem needs all of us, and if we pull in the same direction, we will overcome," Kenyatta said.

A 13-year-old boy died in the capital Nairobi on Monday after being shot while standing on his balcony as police forced people into their homes on the street below. The curfew is among measures that Kenya has taken aimed at slowing the spread of coronavirus. It has also closed borders and schools, and encouraged people to stay at home and avoid gatherings.

Kenya has so far recorded 59 cases of coronavirus and one death.
