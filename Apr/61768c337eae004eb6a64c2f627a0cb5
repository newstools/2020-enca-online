Aleck Skhosana chats to media during the press conference. JOHANNESBURG - Two arbitration matters, one suspension, an investigation, a new acting president and all that in a matter of weeks but the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee says there is no need to panic. Sascoc is on another mission to clean up its badly damaged reputation. Controversy has followed Sascoc for years, and that theme continued in the last few weeks but the organisation's new acting president tells eNCA that things are getting better. "It's an overstatement to say things are falling apart or things seem to be falling apart at Sascoc," said acting Sascoc president Aleck Skhosana. "Instead, things are improving at Sascoc over the past few weeks." READ:Â Calls to restart Sascoc voting process One of the recent flashpoints has been the suspension of Barry Hendricks as acting president. Eight of nine board members voted to place him on leave of absence pending an investigation into his conduct. It's a move Hendricks has contested. The man who has replaced him in the interim knows it's another blow to Sascoc's image. "It's very interesting. The nature of sport is like, it's conflict, these are contestations, they must be taken like that as contestations. It's unfortunate that they have moved out of boardroom, they are out there in the public, which is not a good thing also," Skhosana said. But Skhosana says the fallout may give the public a look into the workings of Sascoc. READ: Sascoc faces tough questions from MPs on reforms The organisation appears less evasive about the damage years of bad publicity has caused. The cash-strapped Sascoc is still hoping for funding from the National Lotteries Commission and the Sports Department but that will depend on whether the organisation is able get its house in order.
