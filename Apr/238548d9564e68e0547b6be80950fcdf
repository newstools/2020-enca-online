We recommend them particularly where people have any cough or any symptoms or in a situation where social distancing is a bit difficult. The issue of COVID-19 being an airborne infection is something that came out in the papers but WHO disputed that. As far as we're aware, it's a droplet infection", said Mkhize. Meanwhile, the Western Cape Health Department warned against the use of masks and gloves as it could increase the risk of spreading coronavirus if not used properly. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
