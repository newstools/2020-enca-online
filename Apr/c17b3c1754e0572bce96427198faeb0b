British PM Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital after suffering persistent coronavirus symptoms for more than 10 days. LONDON - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was stable in intensive care on Tuesday after receiving oxygen support to help him battle COVID-19, while his foreign minister led the government's response to the outbreak. The upheaval of Johnson's personal battle with the virus has shaken the government just as the United Kingdom, now in its third week of virtual lockdown, enters what scientists say will be the most deadly phase of the pandemic which has already killed 5,373 people in the country. Johnson was admitted to St Thomas' Hospital across the River Thames from the House of Commons late on Sunday after suffering persistent coronavirus symptoms, including a high temperature and a cough, for more than 10 days.

He was still conscious, his office said. "He is receiving standard oxygen treatment and breathing without any other assistance," Johnson's spokesman told reporters. "The prime minister has been stable overnight and remains in good spirits," the spokesman said. "He has not required mechanical ventilation or non-invasive respiratory support."

Queen Elizabeth wished Johnson a "full and speedy recovery" and sent a message of support to his pregnant fiancée, Carrie Symonds, and his family.
