Benefits of buying off-plan Take care There are not many potential negatives associated with buying off-plan, but it’s important to be aware of them nonetheless. Do your homework When buying off-plan, research into the developer is an essential piece of homework that you should do. These are some of the important things to look into: • Find out how long they’ve been in business and check out the track record of the developer. • Look at their previous developments and how well they were built. • Download or get hold of former projects’ marketing brochures and compare them to the finished properties. • Try to contact past customers to find out about their experiences of dealing with the developer. You could also look online for reviews or mentions on social media. • Once construction starts, visit the site when you’re able to, to see how work is progressing.
