READ: Ravele withdraws from Sascoc presidency run Deputy Sports Minister Nocawe Mafu said, “it’s not something we are happy about that they would be in the media for the wrong reasons – we are concerned about that. Remember, they are the custodians of the sport in the country, and we’d like to all the time have positive vibe about sport in the country, so it is something we are worried about.” The department will provide an update on the way forward with regards to Hendricks’ suspension after a meeting with Sascoc.

"Once federations all have their houses in order, that means the athletes can then concentrate on what is important to them – playing the sport that they love.” Sascoc's elections -- planned for the end of March -- have been postponed indefinitely, due to the National State of Disaster regulations.
