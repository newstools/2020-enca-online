File: The Lions' 2017 tour to New Zealand ended in a draw. WELLINGTON - British and Irish Lions coach Warren Gatland has proposed a series "decider" between the All Blacks and his composite team when the coronavirus crisis is over. Gatland oversaw the Lions' 2017 tour to New Zealand when a 15-15 deadlock at Eden Park meant the three-Test series ended in a draw. Players from both sides expressed disappointment at the time that no one had won the series and Gatland said a one-off Test next year could decide the issue once and for all.

The Lions tour South Africa next year and Gatland said he was already in discussions with New Zealand Rugby about the Maori All Blacks playing a warm-up game against them before they depart. But he suggested the full New Zealand Test team should be involved in the fixture instead.

Gatland also floated the idea of Southern Hemisphere nations travelling to the north in November this year for a round-robin tournament in which revenues would be shared. The former Wales coach is currently in charge of Waikato Chiefs but will take over at the Lions again for next year's South Africa tour.
