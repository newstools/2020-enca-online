South Africans still can't buy alcohol or cigarettes. But lockdown could be a little easier that's with some new rules coming into effect. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa has rejected calls for the lifting of the alcohol ban. Ramaphosa has instead directed liquor sellers to seek economic relief through programs offered by government. This after the Gauteng Liquor Forum demanded that the total ban on alcohol sales for the period of the lockdown be lifted.
