Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The police ministry said on Sunday it had caught police officers who were complicit in illegal alcohol sales. South Africa banned the sale of all alcohol and cigarettes under a coronavirus lockdown that triggered a wave of lootings of liquor shops. Police minister Bheki Cele says the ban on all sales of alcohol has helped lower crime during the coronavirus lockdown.

In a statement, the police ministry said Cele condemned the "opportunistic criminal behaviour" after at least 16 reported instances of burglary and the looting of liquor stores in the Western Cape. Cele "has in the meantime noted with concern the alleged involvement of police members in some of the liquor-related crimes," it continued.

Two further members of the police in another province were caught on Friday escorting three light pick-up trucks loaded with alcohol, the statement said. Those who undermine the effort to stem the spread of the coronavirus would be found and dealt with decisively, the statement said. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
