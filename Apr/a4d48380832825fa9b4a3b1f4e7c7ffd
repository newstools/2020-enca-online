 JOHANNESBURG - A pride of lions flops lazily across a track at a South African game reserve, enjoying newfound tranquillity since last month's closure of all national parks to support an anti-coronavirus lockdown. Rather than the usual Land Rover, a lone elephant rumbles down the road, causing the felines to scatter into the surrounding bush. A vehicle stands in the background, live-streaming the scene for thousands of people watching the animals from the comfort of their homes. "Since the lockdown occurred we have seen an amazing explosion in our audience," said Graham Wallington, head of a live safari broadcaster called WildEarth. WildEarth operates from two vehicles in two private game reserves bordering the internationally famous Kruger National Park.  Guides take viewers along for a virtual game drive, finding wildlife and sharing facts about animals encountered along the way. Participants can also send questions to the guides as they go along. Aside from providing entertainment, Wallington believes virtual safaris are an opportunity to observe how wildlife behave in the absence of tourists. "It's kind of an interesting time where the animals are being left alone," Wallington said, adding that rare species such as the endangered African wild dogs had started venturing into his areas. "Wild dogs coming in and hunting almost every day... is unheard of," he exclaimed. "It's because there is no one else there and they've got the run of the place for themselves."
