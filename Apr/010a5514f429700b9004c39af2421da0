It says there's a personal vendetta against the MEC of Health Dr Phophi Ramathuba. “The allegations are misdirected. The MEC for health is not responsible for implementation of protocols and guidelines. If anything, I am the accounting officer of the Department of Health. If there were any allegations leveled, they should be leveled to me and the MEC...” said Limpopo Health HOD, Thokozani Mhlongo.
