Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The DA says it will hold its much-anticipated policy conference to decide its identity, online. This as the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak and the lockdown have left political parties hamstrung. The DA currently has an interim leader – and faces an internal debate about the place of race-based redress. The party says its day-to-day workings, continue. “It’s been possible to carry on running the party almost without missing a beat. We’ve continued all the major meetings, all the major processes, polling operation, policy operation, governance operation and it’s been extraordinary how we’ve been able to do online,” said DA Federal Council Chairperson, Helen Zille. READ: DA to elect new party leader Zille says the party hopes to use this new system to hold its policy conference online. “Having 300 people in a policy discussion is a very different order of magnitude and we will have to discuss that," Zille said. "We’ve set up our policy portal which enables everybody to comment beforehand, enables us to collate those comments, put them together so people can see their comments have been considered, then we can debate them point by point, enable people to raise their hands online, make appoint, speak in chatrooms and eventually go to a secure vote.” DA members could soon be electing a new leader, from their laptops. The elective conference is scheduled to take place in October
