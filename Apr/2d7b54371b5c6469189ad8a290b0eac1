 LONDON - Tom Moore, a 99-year-old British war veteran walking his garden for the health service, has raised more than $15-million. Retired army captain Moore, who has used a rollator to move around since breaking his hip, has set himself the target of walking the 25 metres around his garden 100 times before his 100th birthday on April 30. Moore, raised in Yorkshire, northern England, served in India, Burma and Sumatra during World War Two.
