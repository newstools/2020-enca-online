The agreement is meant to advance children's rights in all spheres, including policies and actions against COVID-19 regardless of migratory status. "The agreement highlights a number of issues that we will work with together with UNICEF, so UNICEF will help us to enhance our capacity as a commission in promoting children's rights in terms of protection, monitoring and raising awareness around children's rights,"Â said the commission's Tseliso Thipanyane. Thipanyane says COVID-19 poses a serious challenge to human rights. "The powerless will suffer the most and in this case children and therefore we need to pay careful attention that through this episode children's rights are not undermined."
