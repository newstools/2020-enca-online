- Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering PARIS - The first person to officially die from the novel coronavirus was a 61-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan on January 9. Now, three months later, by April 10, more than 100,000 people have succumbed to the disease. First Asia, then Europe in March and now the United States have each, in turn, become the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced more than half of humanity into lockdown. Despite sometimes draconian confinement measures, the number of daily deaths has accelerated across the globe -- from fewer than 500 per day in mid-March, to more than 5,000 at the start of April and now nearly 7,500. WATCH: Coronavirus deaths in South Africa rise to 24 In the last eight days, more deaths were registered than in the preceding 84 days. In all, at least 102,774 people have died from coronavirus, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre. More than 1.6 million declared cases have been registered in 193 countries, of which at least 335,900 are considered recovered. READ: Lockdown extended by two weeks The tallies, using data collected by AFP from national authorities and information from the World Health Organization (WHO), probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections. Many countries are only testing the most serious cases. Others do not have a policy of large-scale testing when resources are severely lacking, as in Africa. "There are problems with all the indicators, but the number of cases depends a lot on the number of tests," said French epidemiologist Catherine Hill.
