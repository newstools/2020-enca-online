NAIROBI - Coronavirus-linked flight restrictions are hampering efforts to wipe out locust swarms on the verge of devastating crops in eastern Africa, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said. The curbs have delayed deliveries of pesticides and, at the current rate of spraying, stocks in Kenya will run out within days, Cyril Ferrand, FAO's head of resilience for Eastern Africa, told Reuters.

Locust numbers exploded late last year, encouraged by unusual weather patterns amplified by climate change, and swarms disbursed eastwards from Yemen, with Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia the hardest hit countries.

"They are very active, very voracious, and very mobile," Ferrand said. "...If we don't have pesticides, our planes cannot fly and people cannot spray and if we are not able to control these swarms, we will have big damage to crops."
