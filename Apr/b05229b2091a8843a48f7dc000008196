"The Open was due to be played in Kent from 12-19 July but it has been necessary to cancel the championship based on guidance from the UK Government, the health authorities, public services and the R&A's advisers," organisers R&A said in a statement on Monday. St Andrews will still host the 150th British Open, but a year later than scheduled in 2022.

We care deeply about this historic championship and have made this decision with a heavy heart," R&A chief executive Martin Slumbers said. "We have explored every option for playing The Open this year but it is not going to be possible. "We rely on the support of the emergency services, local authorities and a range of other organisations to stage the Championship and it would be unreasonable to place any additional demands on them when they have far more urgent priorities to deal with. "We appreciate that this will be disappointing for a great many people around the world but we have to act responsibly during this pandemic and it is the right thing to do."
