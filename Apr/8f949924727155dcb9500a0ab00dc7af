Pikotaro has repurposed the catchy if bizarre hit to promote proper handwashing as the world battles the global coronavirus pandemic. TOKYO - The Japanese comedian who stormed the world with his nonsense 'Pineapple-pen' hit and even entertained President Donald Trump is back with a new message: Wash your hands! READ: 'Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen' sets Guinness record The entertainer known as Pikotaro grabbed a Guinness World Record in 2016 for his 45-second "Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen" or "PPAP" hit, which became the shortest song to break into the Billboard Hot 100.  And now he has repurposed the catchy if bizarre hit to promote proper handwashing as the world battles the global coronavirus pandemic. Dressed in his trademark garish animal print with a pencil-thin moustache, Pikotaro swaps out his "I have a pen. I have an apple. Apple pen!" lyrics for "I have a hand. I have a soap. Wash! Wash! Wash! Wash!" "Clean hand, clean hand," he adds, displaying his palms before pressing them together, "Pray for People and Peace (PPAP)."  In just three days, the song has racked up over three million views on YouTube, and the comedian's Twitter page has been flooded with videos of Japanese children laughing and imitating his handwashing dance.
