Queen Elizabeth thanked health workers around the world on World Health Day. LONDON - Britain's Queen Elizabeth sent a message of "enduring appreciation and good wishes" to health workers around the world for World Health Day. "I want to thank all those working in the healthcare profession for your selfless commitment and diligence as you undertake vitally important roles to protect and improve the health and well-being of people," the queen said.   The queen's words were shown on a video released by the royal family's Twitter account, which featured images of the queen and other members of her family visiting hospitals and meeting healthcare workers. Included in the video were three of the queen's children: Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, Princess Anne, and Prince Edward. The queen's grandson Prince William and his wife Kate Middleton were also pictured. "In testing times, we often observe that the best of the human spirit comes to the fore; the dedication to service of countless nurses, midwives and other health workers, in these most challenging of circumstances, is an example to us all," she said.
