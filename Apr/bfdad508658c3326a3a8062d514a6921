"Captain Tom" Moore celebrates his 100th birthday on Thursday. LONDON - Britain will celebrate the 100th birthday of the World War II veteran whose staggering fundraising efforts inspired the country during the depths of its coronavirus outbreak. Having served his country in the last century, "Captain Tom" Moore recently thrust himself into the thick of Britain's latest battle by doing 100 laps of his garden and raising over £29-million for healthcare workers treating coronavirus patients. His efforts and humility have propelled him to iconic status, with a high-speed train named after him and all letters sent in the British postal service this week carrying a birthday message. The pensioner from Yorkshire, northern England, has also received more than 125,000 birthday cards from around the world, enough to fill the vast hall of his grandson Benjie's school. The captain's latest mission began on April 6, with the target of raising £1,000 for groups linked to the National Health Service as a thank you for the treatment he received while suffering with cancer and a broken hip.

But the generosity of the public far exceeded his hopes, and he received millions within days. Dressed in a tie and jacket decorated with medals, Moore completed the final leg of his journey just 10 days later, crossing the line with the aid of his walking frame and a military guard of honour. "I'm feeling fine, I hope you are all feeling fine too," the former engineer, who served in India and Myanmar, said after completing his mission. Since then he has become a living legend, praised by the government as a "source of inspiration" for the country at a time of deep crisis. Captain Tom is to become Colonel Tom as the MoD has announced an honorary promotion for his 100th birthday.
