Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Technology is proving to be a big help in keeping people informed about COVID-19 and the Gauteng government is using an app to do just that. The Gauteng Health Department’s Mpilo app - which was launched in September - has been revamped to include features on COVID-19. It will help people identify symptoms, call ambulances and get answers to frequently asked questions. The patient-engagement app is free of charge on most networks including MTN, Cell C and Telkom. It can be downloaded on all IOS and Android devices.

"Now this will help us to track from our side and make sure the routes they take are safe routes”.
