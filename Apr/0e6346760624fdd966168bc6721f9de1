In the magazine, "Private Benjamin" star Hawn and "Almost Famous" actress Hudson talk about their relationship and the challenges of parenting. "Mom was my greatest cheerleader. And it just made me think about Rani ... going, 'I hope I give her that kind of confidence,' you know?" Hudson told the magazine. What a joy to celebrate the BEAUTY of family on @people The Beautiful Issue 💝Mama, Rani Rose and I shot this cover months ago, little did everyone in the world know that we would all be having to make ourselves distant from some family for a while. Some can quarantine with each other, and some, sadly, cannot. The strength of family is everything! ✨Whether you are born into that family or collect that family along the way, this connection we thrive on and must protect 🙏 I hope this interview brings some cheer to everyone and our family is sending you so much love 💕 Tomorrow I will be sharing some of my favorite beautiful people right now and donating to their causes! Hopefully you will join me. Until tomorrow 😘 A post shared by  Kate Hudson (@katehudson) on Apr 21, 2020 at 6:25pm PDT The double issue, on newsstands on Friday, contains 40 pages of other stars, including actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Rita Wilson who photographed themselves for the "Barefaced Beauties" section.
