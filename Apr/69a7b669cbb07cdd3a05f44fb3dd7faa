File: England's Jos Buttler (R) celebrates with the World Cup trophy on the pitch after the 2019 Cricket World Cup final between England and New Zealand at Lord's Cricket Ground in London on July 14, 2019. ENGLAND - Wicketkeeper-batsman Jos Buttler has said he will auction the shirt he wore in England's 2019 World Cup final victory to raise funds for efforts to fight the coronavirus. Buttler was instrumental in England's thrilling victory over New Zealand in the final at Lord's last year, scoring a half-century and then dislodging the stumps to run out Martin Guptill off the final ball of the super over. The 29-year-old has placed the shirt on the auction website eBay and all the funds raised will go to the Royal Brompton and Harefield hospitals' charity.

"As we all know, hospitals, doctors, nurses and the NHS are all doing quite an incredible job at the moment," said Buttler. "And in the weeks and months to come, they are going to need our support even more." The highest bid on Wednesday was 65,700 pounds.
