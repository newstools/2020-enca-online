The Nkandla Municipality had no leaders for the better part of Thursday. The Mayor, Deputy Mayor and Speaker, were all arrested for allegedly violating lockdown regulations. Siphamandla Goge caught up with the mayor soon after his release. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Nkandla Local Municipality’s senior leadership has been arrested for allegedly violating the lockdown regulations. The mayor, his deputy and the municipal speaker were nabbed by the police at a local taxi rank while distributing food parcels to street vendors. But, the accused deny the charges, saying their arrests are politically motivated. They’ve been granted R1,000 bail each but Nkandla Mayor Thami Ntuli denies he organised the masses. READ: Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams placed on special leave “There were other people who were in the taxi rank. When we arrived we were able to say no, this program is only for those who are selling here. People must be away from where we were and then they stood in groups in different areas. And those who had to receive the support from the municipality, they had to come one by one.” READ: Mbalula lays charge against Somizi Ntuli suspects foul play. He says he will continue running the municipality's food distribution programme, but will adhere to the lockdown rules. Ntuli and his co-accused are due back in court on 19 May.
