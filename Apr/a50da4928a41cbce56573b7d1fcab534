File: UWC has virtually conferred 3,945 certificates, diplomas, and degrees on graduated on Tuesday. CAPE TOWN - Students at the University of the Western Cape are celebrating their graduations, from a distance. The COVID-19 pandemic that necessitated a national 21-day lockdown has come with regulations forbidding large gatherings, forcing universities to create innovative coping strategies. WEEK IN ONE: Universities' response to COVID-19 UWC has virtually conferred 3,945 certificates, diplomas, and degrees on graduated on Tuesday. These include 57 Doctoral degrees, 198 Master’s degrees, 1,031 Honours degrees, 2,079 Bachelor’s degrees, 434 diplomas, and 146 certificates. UWC Registrar, Dr Nita Lawton-Misra, said graduate employability is one of the three pillars of UWC’s 60th celebrations, and the University will not hold its graduates back from entering the job market. “Today marks a momentous point in UWC's history. Under ordinary circumstances we would have been celebrating our students' achievements with their loved ones on campus,” said Dr Lawton-Misra. “However, extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures and being able to allow our students who have worked hard to get to this point in their lives the opportunity to graduate and receive their certificates digitally gives true meaning to the rhetoric on the 4th industrial revolution." "Congratulations to all students who have graduated today! May this be the beginning of even greater moments in your lives. Well done!”
