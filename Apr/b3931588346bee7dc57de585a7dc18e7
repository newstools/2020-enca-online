The much-anticipated "Friends" reunion special on HBO's new streaming service HBO Max was announced in February. But filming has been delayed because of the coronavirus outbreak, which halted all television and movie production more than a month ago. The hit comedy series ended in 2004 but found a new life on streaming platforms. HBO Max will launch on May 27, officials said on Tuesday, but the "Friends" reunion was not among the shows listed as available at launch.
