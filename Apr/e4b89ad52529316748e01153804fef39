The FBI highlighted the problem of "Zoombombing" by hackers or uninvited guests who harass Zoom video conferences with hate speech or pornography. SAN FRANCISCO - Videoconferencing group Zoom pledged to step up privacy and safety controls after a series of complaints about the application which has surged in popularity during the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement late Wednesday, Zoom founder and chief executive Eric YuanÂ said the company would be "shifting all our engineering resources to focus on our biggest trust, safety, and privacy issues." Yuan said Zoom would work with third-party experts and users on a review "to understand and ensure the security of all of our new consumer use cases" and step up a "bug bounty" program to find security weaknesses.

The FBI's Boston office warned on Monday that it had "received multiple reports of conferences being disrupted by pornographic and/or hate images and threatening language." New York Attorney General Letitia James sent a letter to the California enterprise this week "with a number of questions to ensure the company is taking appropriate steps to ensure users' privacy and security," a spokesman said.
