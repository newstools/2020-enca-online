PRETORIA - The lockdown has many feeling like they're running round in circles. But one ultramarathon athlete from Gauteng is using his time wisely. Bennie Roux has completed the "Comrades marathon" -- in his yard. He's also managed to raise R70,000 for a school for disabled children in Kempton Park. He says it was much harder to complete the marathon at his home, than on the road.
â€œThe running time on my watch was 10 hours 29, but if you add all the time that I stopped, it was about 11 hours and 50," he said.
