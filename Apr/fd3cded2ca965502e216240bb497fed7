The testing process starts with a delivery of samples before they are sorted at a designated COVID-19 station. Extraction is the process of removing a sample from the swab and it's then prepared for the testing machine to identify traces of the virus, if it's present. "Those results are then analysed and out pathologist authorised those results once it has been placed onto our laboratory information system,” said Dr Florette Treurnicht, Virology HOD at NHLS and Wits.
