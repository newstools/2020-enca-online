File: Under laws aimed at stopping the spread of the virus, the lovelorn Aussie was required to isolate for 14 days. SYDNEY - An Australian who repeatedly snuck out of coronavirus quarantine, reportedly to visit his girlfriend, was jailed for a month -- the first person imprisoned under the country's lockdown laws. Jonathan David was arrested earlier this month after jamming open a fire escape and slipping out of mandatory quarantine at a Perth hotel, Western Australia Police said in a statement.

By escaping through the fire exit, he successfully avoided hotel staff several times but was caught on CCTV, police said. Under laws aimed at stopping the spread of the virus, David was required to isolate for 14 days after arriving in Perth from the southeastern state of Victoria on March 28.
