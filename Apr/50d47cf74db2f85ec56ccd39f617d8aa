Most of us have been using food as a coping mechanism since the lockdown began. And some of us have run out of recipe ideas. Chef Pitso Chauke in partnership with Flora and eNCA gives us some tips on what we can prepare while we are staying safe indoors. Courtesy #DStv403 Pitso Chauke is a Cape Town Based restauranteur and an entrepreneur at heart. He is originally from Limpopo is a small town known as Malamulele. Having grown from a family which is female dominant, Pitso was spoiled by his siblings. His mother, sisters would cook for everyone. Culturally No man would cook for females. That changed when heÂ moved to Durban to study Marketing. He had to cook for himself now that he was not in the presence of his family. He never took notes and that made him start from scratch. He had to start with cooking pilchard tinned fish. Unbeknown to him that his interest of cooking had just begun. 2009 he went to Cape Town to look for a job and got a job at the South African Police services. He worked as a detective for almost ten years. His passion for cooking never died so when he learnt that African cuisine was neglected in Cape Town, He started what is known now as Pitsoskitchen.
