Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Cape Town smokers are celebrating. They'll be able to light up again soon. President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced the ban on cigarette sales will be lifted from 1 May. It's one of several measures government is implementing as it begins to ease lockdown regulations. "If you're stressed out, the first thing you grab is a cigarette. And I had some incident which really drove me to the cigarette, but it came down a lot,” said Evelyn Josephs. READ: Western Cape smokers fuming The Fair Trade Independent Tobacco Association had been planning to take government to court over the ban. This will no longer happen after the President's announcement. “We feel that the situation going into what is now termed Level Four of the lockdown period will ensure now that the fiscus benefits and that a number of jobs along the tobacco industry value chain are retained, amongst many other benefits. So we’re very happy that government has taken such a commendable step,” said Fita chairperson Sinenhlanhla Mnguni. Doctor Richard van Zyl, a consultant pulmonologist at Groote Schuur Hospital, says smoking poses a significant risk factor in cases of severe COVID-19. He says smokers should continue to maintain social distancing and refrain from sharing cigarettes as this increases their risk of infection.
