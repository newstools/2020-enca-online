SA lockdown: Roadblocks tighten, only essential travel permitted But with the baby coming in about two months' time – they're worried they haven't got everything they need. Especially if the lockdown is extended. But they are more worried about those who already have their little ones. “We are expecting, we don’t have the child here yet so we have a bit of time. I wonder what people who are giving birth today or tomorrow are doing. Even for us, we are not prepared enough. We need shops to open so that by the time baby arrives – we are able to cater for all their needs,” added Buhle. WATCH: Comply with lockdown regulations, Mkhize urges Many stores selling baby clothes are closed – and those that are open – are not allowing parents to buy baby clothes and other essentials. It says these retailers have agreed to sell baby products at prices to simply cover the basic cost of production and distribution for the period of the lockdown. Government says hospitals and clinics are also allowed to buy these products directly for the infants in their care.
