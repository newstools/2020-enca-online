"Indiana Jones" star and flying enthusiast Harrison Ford was involved in yet another aviation mishap. LOS ANGELES - US actor Harrison Ford piloted a plane across a runway as another aircraft was taking off, aviation officials said, confirming they have opened an investigation. It is the latest aviation mishap for the 77-year-old "Indiana Jones" star and flying enthusiast, who misheard an air traffic instruction in the incident which did not result in any damage last Friday. "The FAA is investigating an incident in which the pilot of an Aviat Husky taxied across the runway... while another aircraft was performing a touch-and-go landing," the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement to AFP.

Ford had been told to stop as the other plane practised landing and immediately taking off, but instead, he continued across the runway. "Excuse me sir, I thought exactly the opposite. I'm terribly sorry," Ford can be heard saying in an audio recording. Ford avoided punishment over a near-miss aviation incident at another southern California airport in 2017.

Two years earlier, Ford performed an emergency landing after suffering engine failure in a World War II vintage aircraft, hitting a tree and crashing onto a California golf course. He suffered multiple injuries in the 2015 incident, including a broken pelvis and ankle. Representatives for Ford told AFP that "there was never any danger of a collision" in the latest incident.
