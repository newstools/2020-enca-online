Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) says those applying for the COVID-19 relief grant should not go to their offices. This after some potential beneficiaries visited Sassa offices earlier this week but received no help. The R350 monthly grant is to help the jobless who don't get any other form of grant payout. READ: Millions expected to apply for govt relief grant Just over a million people have applied for the R350 monthly COVID-19 relief grant. But there seems to be a duplication in numbers. “What we did when we started, we realised that when we reconciled, 60 percent of people who made the application were not supposed to," said Sassa spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi. READ: Sassa offices reopen Those who have been to Sassa offices have been turned back and asked to use the relevant platforms to apply. "Please do not come to our office because you won’t get help and we don’t want people to come to our office when they won’t get help," said Letsatsi. "We know the stress levels that are there, and people are frustrated. Don’t add on to your frustration by coming to our offices, you won’t get help.” The agency is promising that people will receive their grant within this month. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday.
