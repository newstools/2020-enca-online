File: Former president Jacob Zuma. JOHANNESBURG - The Supreme Court Appeal has dismissed former president Jacob Zuma's bid to appeal a ruling that he had defamed former tourism minister Derek Hanekom. The court has now ordered the former president to apologise. Zuma accused Hanekom of being an enemy agent. Judge Dhaya Pillay dismissed the application for leave to appeal “with costs on the grounds that there is no reasonable prospect of success in an appeal and there is no other compelling reason why an appeal should be heard.” WATCH: Court dismisses Zuma's application for leave to appeal The Pietermaritzburg High Court previously found Zuma's tweet about Hanekom was false and defamatory. It ordered Zuma to delete the post in which he'd claimed that Hanekom was an enemy agent.
