Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG -The South African Prisoners Organisation for Human Rights is calling for government to expand the category for prisoners who qualify for the parole dispensation. Earlier this month, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced he was releasing 19,000 prisoners to curb the spread of COVID-19 in prisons and ease overcrowding. SUMMARY: Lamola explains how special parole will work The organisation says the current criteria is discriminating against prisoners. "These are people who have been in prison for over 10-15 years, are you telling me that a person who was arrested 10 or 15 years ago is still a threat?

Bhudu says the organisation has tried to engage with the government but they have not received a response. The total number of positive cases at correctional facilities around the country is 336. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
