Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula wants government to buy disinfecting booths for Metrorail before it can resume services. Mbalula inspected the Gautrain and its stations, which reopened for business in level 4 of the lockdown on Monday. He says the Gautrain demonstrated it can take precautions to stop the spread of the virus with the new technology. However, he has warned the COVID-19 outbreak is not a get-rich-quick-scheme. READ: Mbalula urges motorists to comply with Level 4 regulations "So if you say to me you've got a booth and we spend a couple of millions for other booths, I see there is value for money it is properly serviced, you've appointed proper people to do that", said Mbalula. The booth costs between R 80-000 and R 150-000 and is locally made. Mbalula has also warned that he won’t allow looters to hijack the demand for the new technology. “Normally in government, you know, in this time, you procure things to make more money and line your pockets. But I want value for money, when I see the booth, I see a value for money.” Over a million South Africans have returned to work on Monday under strict regulations for public transport. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
