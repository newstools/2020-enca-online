World champion Josh Taylor said the absence of a crowd could deprive him of a competitive edge. LONDON - World champion Josh Taylor fears it will be hard to motivate himself for the "glorified sparring" of boxing behind closed doors. It looks increasingly likely that any initial resumption of major sport in Britain, including boxing, will be without spectators. But Taylor said the absence of a crowd could deprive him of a competitive edge. "It would be a bit like a glorified sparring match if there's only 50 people in the building," Taylor told BBC Radio's boxing podcast.

"If the crowd wasn't there you'd lose that wee bit of nervousness walking out. Just as you get ready to walk out, you see the crowd and think 'this is it man, what I live for' and there's no way I'm getting beat. It fires you up." Nevertheless, Taylor said he would consider taking a fight even if there were no spectators.

So I'd go back to that experience to make sure I win the fight." Taylor has a perfect professional record of 16 victories, 12 inside the distance.
