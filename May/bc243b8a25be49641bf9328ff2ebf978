The Snowbirds, formally the 431 Air Demonstration Squadron, had suspended all shows and special events through March and April due to the COVID-19 outbreak. OTTAWA - Canada's Snowbirds, an elite air force aerobatics team, will perform aerial salutes across the country to recognise efforts to stem the coronavirus pandemic. The Snowbirds, formally the 431 Air Demonstration Squadron, had suspended all shows and special events through March and April due to the COVID-19 outbreakÂ to keep pilots safe. "Starting this weekend in Nova Scotia, the Canadian Forces Snowbirds will head across Canada to salute Canadians doing their part to stop the spread of COVID-19," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. "As we watch the Snowbirds fly over our homes, let's remember that we are all in this together," he said. The team's signature nine-jet formation, with trailing white smoke, will perform aerial displays over cities from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans, at elevations as low as 500 feet. Times and locations throughout next week are to be announced on social media platforms each day. "We've been asked to do what we do best ... inspire Canadians," commented the team's commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Mike French.
