File: The sale of cigarettes remains prohibited under alert level 3. JOHANNESBURG - Minister of Cooperative Governance Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma says the law must take its course when people try to buy illegal cigarettes. Dlamini-Zuma was answering questions during a media briefing by the National Coronavirus Command Council on Thursday. "I think it's important that where there's crime, crime is attended to. If you see crime report it to the police, if people are doing something illegal about cigarettes, the law must take its course," she said. The sale of cigarettes remains prohibited under alert level 3. The NCCC has submitted about 4,000 pages on why smoking during the pandemic is risky.
