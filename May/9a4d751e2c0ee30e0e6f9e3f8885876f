South Africa began to gradually loosen its strict COVID-19 coronavirus lockdown on May 1, 2020, allowing some industries to reopen after five weeks of restrictions that plunged its struggling economy deeper into turmoil. JOHANNESBURG - The Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) says employees will now be able to get paid directly. To date, the UIF has paid over R15,7-billion to 2, 288 295 employees in its COVID-19 TERS relief payment. “Of importance is that we have now started paying workers directly to their bank accounts not through employers only. What this means is that workers do not have to wait until employers transfer their benefits to their accounts. While the claim is submitted by the employer who would have all the information that is pertinent to make the payments, the actual payment goes straight to the account of the worker thus eliminating further waiting period,” said the Department of Employment and Labour Minister, Thulas Nxesi. Nxesi says the department has heeded the call to be more responsive.
