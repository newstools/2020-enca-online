File: Joe Root, like any professional cricketer, longed for international cricket but stressed public health was paramount. LONDON - England test captain Joe Root is keen to play international cricket this summer but not by compromising on quality of the game or its intensity, the 29-year-old has said. With professional cricket suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is considering playing the series against West Indies and Pakistan behind closed doors. "If the game is compromised, it shouldn't be going ahead," Root told Sky Sports.

It's not a fair reflection of the sport." England's home series against West Indies scheduled for June has been postponed while the inaugural 'The Hundred', which was to begin in July, has been moved to next year. Root, like any professional cricketer, longed for international cricket but stressed public health was paramount. "The guys are all missing playing and desperate to get back out there but safety is paramount for everyone involved. As soon as that is compromised, this can't happen," he said.
