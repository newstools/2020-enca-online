File: COVID-19 quarantine sites have been set up at South Africa’s gold mines. JOHANNESBURG - The Labour Court in Johannesburg has ruled that mining companies need a code of practice for all workers during COVID-19 after union Amcu took the Mineral Resources and Energy Department to court. READ: Amcu wants government to protect miners against COVID-19 It said there were no clear guidelines on how workers would be protected while on duty during the outbreak. The department opposed the application saying it had provided enough clarity on worker safety. The union wanted the department to act as a regulator and ensure all mining companies implement clear guidelines. The court has ordered that the department's chief inspector must now draw up and implement a code of practice and must do so by 11 May. In the interim, the judge has ordered certain protections.
