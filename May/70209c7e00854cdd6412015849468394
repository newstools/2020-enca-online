Public Works Minister Patricia de Lille told Parliament Monday, it could take several months before the R37-million contract is investigated. It follows criticism about a decision to veer away from standard tender procedure and questions about whether the contract was value for money. The fence has now been completed but has already come under attack from border jumpers and smugglers. READ: Beitbridge fence under scrutiny In March, the Public Works minister announced the country’s border with Zimbabwe would be tightened. Government awarded a tender of R37-million to secure and extend the border fence at Beitbridge for 40 kilometres. De Lille said this was necessary to protect citizens from the spread of COVID-19. But no sooner than the fence was completed, parts of it was being damaged and even removed. “What must be condemned is the criminality and crime taking place on our borders. The crooks are always one step ahead of us. The fence was hardly up for one day when the crooks came through with cases of cigarettes and smuggling goods and all that,” she said.
