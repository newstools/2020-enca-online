Lelly Mntungwa quit her high-end job to reopen a factory that collapsed more than 25-years ago. She now employs more than 50 local women, who produce essentials to fight the spread of COVID-19. Products produced here include face masks, sanitisers and soap.

With rural and far-flung areas seemingly neglected in the fight against COVID-19, Mntungwa donates some of her products to the community. COVID-19: KZN township economy takes hammering “We are happy that masks are produced here. Our community will now be able to get masks because we didn’t know where to get them. We only see people on TV wearing masks. We didn’t know where to get them.” Mntungwa says her aim beyond the COVID-19 outbreak, is to revitalise the ailing textile industry. “This factory used to employ many people but it shut down. As the people of rural Msinga, we wish to see this textile industry revamped and grow so that it will contribute to the local economy.” Mntungwa is calling for more support and funding from government to uplift rural entrepreneurs.
