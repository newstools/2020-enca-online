File: Pakistan's Twenty20 captain, Babar Azam said he has been praying for the continuation of the T20 World Cup. KARACHI - World number one Twenty20 batsman Babar Azam said Monday he was praying the coronavirus pandemic would not scupper his first T20 World Cup as Pakistan skipper. Australia is due to host the seventh Twenty20 World Cup in October and November but organisers face challenges of providing appropriate biosecurity and quarantine measures for 15 international teams. Lingering travel restrictions could also hit the event, where forty-five matches are scheduled to be played in seven cities.

The International Cricket Council will discuss the event at its board meeting in Dubai next week. Azam said he would not mind if cricket was played in closed stadiums, without fans.

Pakistan was forced to play before sparse or no crowds in the UAE, their neutral ground, in the aftermath of the 2009 terrorist attack against a visiting Sri Lanka team in Lahore. International cricket returned gradually to Pakistan from 2015 but it was only last year that the side managed to stage a Test at home after a gap of ten years.
