Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Golden Arrow bus drivers in Cape Town have downed tools over coronavirus safety concerns. At least twenty workers have tested positive for COVID-19. NUMSA Western Cape Regional Secretary Vuyo Lufele says they have not been able to have a meeting with management in order to discuss workers concerns. "We did not have an opportunity to discuss with Golden Arrow as to what must be done after the death of one of the workers and after the infection of a number of workers by this pandemic. READ: Presidency clarifies limits, powers of NCC We have written several letters and they have not found the time to sit down with us to discuss this and we are very concerned", he said. Lufele says a number of workers have been suspended after they refused to work due to safety concerns. "There are a number of our members who have been suspended and ofcourse other unions and we are prepared to go and defend our members against any action that Golden Arrow may take. Simply because Golden Arrow had failed to meet with the union to deal with the issues at hand and have failed to even listen to the workers." - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8 am to 4 pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
