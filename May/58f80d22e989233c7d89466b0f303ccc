Musicians of the Ukrainian Radio Symphony Orchestra wear protective face masks as they take part in one of the first rehearsals after an easing of lockdown measures. KIEV - The symphony orchestra of Ukrainian radio held its first concert recording for TV, radio and online platforms since coronavirus lockdown measures were partially eased in early May. The musicians wore protective masks to match their black-tie outfits. Although two of them usually share one music stand, they had to follow social distancing rules and this affected the orchestra's performance, art director Volodymyr Sheyko told Reuters.

Some connections were broken because of the distance and also because of the masks because some unconscious messages are expressed on people's faces during the performance and musicians react to them," Sheyko said.

Because the orchestra mainly produces content for radio and TV, its musicians are able to play again, unlike their colleagues whose concerts for live audiences are still banned due to coronavirus restrictions.
