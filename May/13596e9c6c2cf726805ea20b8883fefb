Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - COVID-19 deaths in South Africa could reach 48,000 by the expected infection peak in September. The Actuarial Society of South Africa (ASSA) has come up with a COVID-19 model based on assumptions informed by an extensive scientific literature review by its task team. WATCH: Presidency clarifies limits, powers of NCC According to Lusani Mulaudzi, president of the Actuarial Society of SA, the purpose of the model is primarily to assist actuaries. "Actuaries will be getting questions from their clients. What is the impact of COVID-19? So the model is designed in such a way that you can play around with the parameters to see what the results will look like." Mulaudzi says the phased opening of the economy has been factored into SA's projected infection peak of 48,000.

We assumed how effective the lockdown will be because we all don't know what the effect of it was. We'll still see that. And we had to make an assumption around the social distancing mechanisms. What the effect of those would be." READ: Up to 190,000 could die in Africa if virus containment fails: WHO Mulaudzi says on top of COVID-19, there's also an information pandemic.
