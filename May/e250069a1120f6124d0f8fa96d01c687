Some of the people work through many stressful situations," said Cloete. "We are going into a situation where these cases will increase. It is going to be more difficult over the weeks that are coming." Cloete said his department is negotiating with the private sector to potentially have access to additional critical care capacity.

The issue here is about having access to critical staffing," he said. The province is also probing all unexplained deaths. "Ever since COVID-19 became a reality, we have instituted quite strict criteria for all unexplained deaths," Cloete said. "Therefore if there's an unexplained death, we are putting a high alert to be on the lookout for COVID." - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday.
