JOHANNESBURG - The economy will see a slight pick-up in activity on Monday with around 1,5-million people returning to work as lockdown restrictions ease but the livelihoods of millions of others who don’t qualify to work under COVID-19 lockdown restrictions hang in the balance. After a five 5-week lockdown the highway is again carrying essential workers or individuals in those industries permitted to reopen. This is an economy that requires extensive human movement to significantly reactivate which is something COVID-19 prevention measures won't allow immediately. WATCH: Economic Cluster COVID-19 briefing National Treasury said the impact on economic contraction could be anything between 5 to 12-percent for 2020 and these rates could become higher if restrictions remain in place for longer. In its worst-case scenario of a slow economic recovery, Treasury says more than 7-million people could lose their jobs as a result of COVID-19. A quick recovery will still see three-million job losses. The Centre for Development and Enterprise’s Ann Bernstein said there’s no room for political party ideology.
