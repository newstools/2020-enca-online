NEW YORK - As the United States approached 100,000 coronavirus deaths, The New York Times on Sunday marked the grim milestone with a stark memorial on its front page -- one-line obituaries for 1,000 victims. "The 1,000 people here reflect just one percent of the toll. None were mere numbers," the newspaper said in a short introduction on the front page, which was entirely covered in text. The United States has been the hardest-hit country in the coronavirus pandemic by far, in deaths and number of infections.

Victims featured by the Times included "Joe Diffie, Grammy-winning country music star," and "Lila A. Fenwick, first black woman to graduate from Harvard Law School." Also: "Myles Coker, freed from life in prison," "Ruth Skapinok, backyard birds were known to eat from her hand," and "Jordan Driver Haynes, generous young man with a delightful grin."

The milestone of 100,000 deaths loomed as US states across the country ease lockdown measures.
