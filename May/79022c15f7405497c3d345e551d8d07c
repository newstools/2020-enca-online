Colin Slade, a two-time World Cup winner with the All Blacks, spent five years with Pau after joining following his last international appearance in 2015. PAU, France - Former New Zealand fly-half Colin Slade will leave French Top 14 outfit Pau to join Japanese side Dynaboars, the 32-year-old announced. Slade, a two-time World Cup winner with the All Blacks, spent five years with Pau after joining following his last international appearance in 2015. "It's sad to think that my time with Pau is over, but I'm eager to continue my career in Japan next season," he said in an Instagram post. Slade's contract with Pau was due to end in June, but the French rugby season has ended prematurely due to the coronavirus pandemic. He follows in the footsteps of Dan Carter, for whom he served as back-up for most of his international career, in moving to Japan, as the country's league looks to build on the national team's run to the 2019 World Cup quarter-finals as hosts. Carter left Kobe Steelers earlier this year.
