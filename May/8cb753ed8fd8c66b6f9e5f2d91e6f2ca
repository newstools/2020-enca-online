Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Health Minister Zweli Mkhize says government is concerned about the growing numbers of COVID-19 patients in the Western Cape. The province is currently the epicentre of coronavirus in the country with over 4,800 cases. Mkhize visited the province on Saturday and met with Premier Alan Winde, as well as provincial Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo. "We came here because of various concerns that we have, amoung the concerns is the rapid increase in the numbers of people who are positive in the province. READ: 9,420 COVID-19 infections, 186 deaths in SA In this case, we have seen that almost 50% of the positive cases are in the Western Cape and that is a matter of concern to all of us", said Mkhize. Meanwhile, Mkhize says the shortage of COVID-19 testing kits is providing challenges for the government. Over 300 000 tests have been conducted so far. "There is a real shortage of test kits from all over the world and therefore this is putting a little bit of a constraint now on our ability to test as much as we want to." - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
