Government will continue to play a key role in the new South African Airways. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Public Enterprises Department says the embattled South African Airways will not be the old SAA, but a new, restructured one. In a statement released on Friday, the department said it is bringing in strategic partners with the sale of non-core assets and the government will continue to play a key role in the new South African Airways. The department said it is working together with unions to build a business model for the "new national carrier of the future." "Unions and the Department are working together on a business model that deals with what a new national carrier of the future will be but also crucially how this can be achieved to ensure a competitive edge in safety, quality and costs in the sectors which SAA competes."
