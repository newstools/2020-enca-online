Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - In court papers seen by eNCA, Numsa and SACCA have filed an urgent court application to the Labour Appeals Court to stop the SAA business rescue practitioners from implementing a full retrenchment process. The unions say it is unlawful to implement the process as the practitioners have not submitted a business rescue plan. The release of the rescue plan has been extended several times. READ: Smooth landing or liquidation for SAA? The unions have based their argument on the fact that no plan has been presented therefore no retrenchments should be implemented. A deadline for workers, unionised and non-unionised members to sign a proposal to have the entire workforce retrenched is Friday 5pm. However, Numsa, Sacca and the Pilots Association have made it clear they will not sign.
