He says the peak of infection can be lowered if we stick to social distancing and hand sanitising. Otherwise, SA should brace for more infections. WATCH: Professor Karim says COVID-19 here to stay for a while "If we adopt the current strategies of social distancing, wearing our mask, hand sanitising, wearing our masks when we go into shopping malls and public transport, we could be in a situation where we have a lower peak than what is predicted." "It is in our hands, if we choose not to follow those rules then we can expect that the peak might even be bigger," Karim said. Professor Karim also weighed in on the debate around reopening schools. He says children should return to the classroom, provided proper sanitation regulations are followed but he warns that small outbreaks of infection should be expected at schools from time to time.
