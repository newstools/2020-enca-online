Brazilian retired football player Ronaldinho (C) and his brother Roberto Assis (R) arrive at Asuncion's Justice Palace to appear before a public prosecutor who will decide whether to grant them bail or not following their irregular entry to the country, in Asuncion, on March 7, 2020. PARAGUAY - Brazilian great Ronaldinho's lawyers are hoping the former world player of the year will be allowed to go home after more than two months of detention in Paraguay over a forged passport. "We're hoping to convince the prosecution to allow Ronaldinho and his brother to return to their country. We can do nothing but wait for the investigation to end," a defense source told AFP. Former Barcelona, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain star Ronaldinho and his brother, Robert de Assis Moreira, are facing up to five years in jail if convicted.

The 2005 Ballon d'Or winner and his brother posted bail of $1.6-million and have been under house arrest at the plush Palmaroga Hotel in the historic centre of the Paraguayan capital Asuncion since April 7. The public prosecutor has six months to investigate the case, and has ordered the arrest of 18 in connection with it. "There is not one single serious proof that incriminates him," Rogelio Delgado, president of Paraguay's footballers union told AFP. "Although he has a luxury prison, it's very unfair that he's still being detained," added Delgado, a former Paraguay international.
