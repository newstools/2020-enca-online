Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Unemployment Insurance Fund and SA Road and Passenger Bargaining Council are at loggerheads over money that hasn't been paid out. Only two of the 106 approved companies the council represents have received UIF payments. The UIF says it's been inundated with calls by thousands of workers anxiously waiting for payouts. The UIF says it's paid R9.4-billion to 123,000 companies during the lockdown.

And I don't think they might be aware that their account is inactive or has been deactivated,” said UIF Commissioner, Teboho Maruping. But the council denies these claims and says this delay has placed it and many other companies under severe strain. “At this stage, the Bargaining Council is being accused of withholding money up to the point where workers think the Bargaining Council is even stealing their money we haven't received a cent. Employers are accused of withholding money and stealing money meanwhile employers haven't received a cent from the Bargaining Council,” said SA Road Passenger Bargaining Council (Sarpbac) general secretary, Gary Wilson. Sarpbac says the delay affects over 22,000 of its workers. WATCH: Hundreds of thousands of workers may not receive UIF payments It says around R100-million is needed to offer its companies some relief during this economic crisis. The UIF says it hopes to resolve the matter soon to avoid unrest between workers and their employers.
