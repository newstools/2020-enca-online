15-time major champion Tiger Woods breaks down the golf swings of Super Bowl champions Tom Brady and Peyton Manning. MIAMI - Tiger Woods couldn't resist a little last-minute needling before Sunday's charity showdown with Phil Mickelson, with a deadpan prediction that he and partner Peyton Manning would dominate. "At the end of the day, our team's going to win, it's just a matter of how much we're going to win by," 15-time major champion Woods said in an interview posted on Golf Digest's YouTube channel. "Do we keep it close, do we blow them out ... we don't want to have viewers turn off if we're 9-up through nine, that's probably not going to be good. So we'll just be 8-up through nine -- something like that."
