Some residents are outraged after being charged as much as triple what they should have been. “There was a system glitch that the team is attending to so that when the bill is issued, we want to correct that anomaly," said Finance MMC Jolidee Matongo. "This pandemic is presenting an opportunity for us. If you are a world-class African city, we must read bills remotely.” WATCH: Joburg’s billing crisis remains a mess Joburg Water has made an undertaking that its staff will soon be going out to ensure that meter reading is done accurately. “That matter our team is aware of that, it’s working around the clock to correct the readings," said Joburg Water's Isaac Dhludhlu. "We are appealing to our residents to open their homes now.” Municipalities are appealing to residents who can still afford to pay to do so and fulfil their debt commitments so that municipalities can continue to provide water, electricity and other key services.
