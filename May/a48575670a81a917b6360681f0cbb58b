GENEVA - World Health Organization member states agreed to an independent probe into the UN agency's coronavirus response as US criticism mounted over its handling of the pandemic. Countries taking part in the WHO's annual assembly, being held virtually for the first time, adopted a resolution by consensus urging a joint response to the crisis. The resolution, tabled by the European Union, called for an "impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation" of the international response to the pandemic, which has so far infected more than 4.8 million people and killed over 318,000.

The United States did not disassociate itself from the consensus as some had feared after Washington chastised the WHO on the first day of the assembly Monday and lashed out further against China over its role in the outbreak. US President Donald Trump threatened to pull the United States out of the WHO, accusing it of botching the global coronavirus response and of being a "puppet of China".
