LOS ANGELES - Tom Cruise will film his next Hollywood blockbuster on location -- 400 kilometres up in the air and orbiting the Earth once every 90 minutes. The "Top Gun" star is flying through the stratosphere to shoot an as-yet-unknown film aboard the International Space Station (ISS), NASA said.

Entertainment website Deadline Hollywood first reported rumours of the film shoot on the weekend, adding that tech mogul Elon Musk's SpaceX venture was attached to the project. SpaceX is slated to launch astronauts to space from US soil for the first time in nearly a decade later this month aboard the Crew Dragon, which will dock with the ISS.

Deadline Hollywood said there were few other details known about the movie project but reported it was not part of Cruise's box office hit franchise "Mission: Impossible". The seventh film in that series is set to hit screens next year after production was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.
