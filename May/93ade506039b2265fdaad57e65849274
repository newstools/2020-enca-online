Gustav Lloyd Agerblad looks at his new tattoo of Sweden's state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, the face of the country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. STOCKHOLM - While Sweden's softer approach to the new coronavirus has drawn international attention, the country's state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has become a household name for Swedes and on Monday, his face was immortalised in a tattoo. Strange tattoos are plentiful around the world, but you'd probably still be hard-pressed to find one of a star epidemiologist. But on Monday, 32-year-old admirer Gustav Lloyd Agerblad from Stockholm had a portrait of Tegnell's stern-looking face permanently inked on his left arm. "I like to have tattoos that represent something for me and, I mean, this COVID-19 will be a part of my life, for the rest of my life," Agerblad told AFP while reclining in the tattoo parlour's chair. "So I wanted to have the Swedish face of the crisis on my arm," he added. Giving updates at daily press briefings, Tegnell, the state epidemiologist at Sweden's Public Health Agency, has come to represent the Swedish approach, which has remained steadfast even as other countries have opted for much more restrictive measures. A growing number of supporters have also put his face on T-shirts and wall-prints.
