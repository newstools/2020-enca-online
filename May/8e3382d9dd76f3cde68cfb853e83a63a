Real estate agent Dana Scanlon conducts a virtual tour of a house with a client over Facetime in Washington. WASHINGTON - Sporting rubber gloves, realtor Dana Scanlon opens the shutters in a house and turns on the lights, making sure that everything is in order before her client visits -- virtually, due to the coronavirus. "It's all very odd. It's all very different," she said. "We're completely reinventing how we do things in the short run."

But for the time being, it's the end of the American tradition of "open houses," when potential buyers could on a Saturday or Sunday stroll through houses newly-placed on the market.
