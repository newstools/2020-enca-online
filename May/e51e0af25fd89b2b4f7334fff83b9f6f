ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe says singling her out is wrong as the decision was taken collectively. “When she pronounced the decision she was doing so empowered by the disaster management act and her capacity as the incumbent minister...It appeared as if she was being isolated,” Mabe said. “The national coronavirus command council is made out of various ministers...singling one on a decision of a collective is rather unfair. It smugs of racial tirade…its rather unfair."
