NEW DELHI,Â India - Namaste and clapping could replace handshakes and high-fives when cricket resumes after the coronavirus pandemic, India's Ajinkya Rahane said. Wicket celebrations might look very different post-coronavirus, the 31-year-old batsman said, predicting many changes on and off the field.

"Maybe handshakes will be replaced by a namaste," he added, referring to the Indian greeting where both hands are brought together in front of the chest. "But once sport resumes, you can't take anything for granted. The safety of the fans will be of utmost importance. There will be changes in lifestyle while travelling." The COVID-19 outbreak has brought the sporting world to a halt, with the 2020 Olympics postponed for a year and cricket's richest club tournament, the Indian Premier League, delayed indefinitely.

"We would be needing three to four weeks of proper practice before playing any kind of competitive game," said Rahane, speaking as brand ambassador of the ELSA (English Language Speech Assistant) app. "I am missing my batting. But obviously, cricket should only start when we get a vaccine to fight the virus."
