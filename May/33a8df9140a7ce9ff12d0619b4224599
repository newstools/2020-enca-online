Located about 130km west of Tokyo, Mount Fuji rises to 3,776 meters and attracts multitudes of hikers and tourists during its climbing season, which runs from July to September. TOKYO - The climbing season for Mount Fuji, Japan's highest peak, is cancelled for this year after local officials announced that the mountain trails leading up to the summit will stay closed throughout the summer due to the novel coronavirus. Shizuoka Prefecture, which manages three of the four trails that lead to the peak, made the announcement on Monday, following a similar announcement made by a neighbouring prefecture that manages the fourth trail. Shizuoka made the decision to keep the trails shut because "we cannot guarantee the safety of the climbers", as mountain lodges and first-aid centers will be closed to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, said Yoshinari Nushida, a section chief for the Mount Fuji public work office.
