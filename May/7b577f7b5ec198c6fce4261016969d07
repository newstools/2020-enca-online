BRUSSELS - European Union states -- along with Brexiting Britain -- implemented a ban on sales of menthol and other flavoured cigarettes as a public health measure. Smokers and suppliers have had some time to get used to the idea. The ban was passed in 2014 and a four-year market transition began in 2016. But menthol-flavoured tobacco is still popular in some areas, particularly in the east of the EU, and officials expect many consumers will turn to the black market.

Anti-tobacco campaigners, who see flavoured cigarettes as one of the ways the industry tempts young smokers to develop an unhealthy habit, welcomed the move. "It's just a shame it's taken so long," said Deborah Arnott of British anti-smoking group ASH, warning that 280 English children start smoking every day. But smokers' rights group Forest disagreed, arguing that Canada's experience shows a menthol ban did not reduce child smoking but reduced freedom of choice for adults.

Polish consumer group Forum Konsumentow published a survey showing that 51 percent of smokers even didn't know the long-planned ban was imminent. And 20 percent of respondents said they'd be ready to buy black-market menthol cigarettes.
