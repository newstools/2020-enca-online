READ: Tobacco association heads to court to fight ban Government says this is to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The association wants government to provide it with records and minutes of meetings where the decision to reinstitute the ban was taken. “Government has given us a number of concessions...which rendered the need to argue part A of our application no longer necessary. We've been granted the necessary relief now we deal with part B, which is to argue that the ban on the sale of cigarettes was not rationale and we'll base our argument on the record of decision which will be provided to us by government,” said Fita chairperson Sinenhlanhla Mnguni.
