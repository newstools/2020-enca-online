Minister of Employment and Labour Thulas Nxesi says under alert level 3 lockdown, employers need to appoint COVID-19 compliance officers. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Unemployment Insurance Fund has paid out over R15-billion to over 3-million people due to the impact of COVID, that’s according to Minister of Employment and Labour Thulas Nxesi. South Africa has been under a nationwide lockdown since late March, which has resulted in people losing their income. “These dispensements have been in lieu of salaries that could not be paid or a top-up where salaries have been reduced,” Nxesi said. The minister said government will continue to process April applications as well as resolve the outstanding queries.

According to the minister, a damaged fibre link between the UIF offices and the State Information and Technology Agency's data centre caused the glitch. South Africa will move to alert level three of the lockdown from 1 June and Nxesi believes this will ease the financial burden of the UIF. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday.
