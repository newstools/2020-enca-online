"There is a lot of uncertainty. We are listening to what the sport's ministry and the government are telling us about whether we'll be able to have fans in the stadium. "There are different opinions and no-one is sure if we'll be able to have fans or if it'll have to be behind closed doors."

"I think in the next few weeks we'll have more clarity but right now we're trying to be prepared," he added. "People are working from home and obviously we can't go to Madrid to look at facilities, we are prepared in case we end up being able to organise it."
