This is Grimes' first child, while Musk already has five sons. He has been divorced three times -- twice from the same woman. Grimes, 32, whose real name is Claire Boucher, announced she was pregnant in January on Instagram. She shared a topless photo of herself with a baby bump and wrote in the caption that "being knocked up is a very feral & war-like state of being." The couple made waves with their first public appearance together at the Met Gala in 2018, surprising both the music and business worlds. Grimes wore a choker shaped like the Tesla logo to further demonstrate their relationship status. Musk, known for his grand ambition and brash demeanour, had already been in the news the past week when he went on a Twitter rant that included saying Tesla's stock was overvalued. The comment sent shares of the electric carmaker tumbling.
