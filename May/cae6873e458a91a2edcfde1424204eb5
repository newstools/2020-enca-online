DUBLIN - This year's Dublin marathon scheduled for October 25 was cancelled despite Ireland's move to lift coronavirus lockdown measures, indicating potential long-term disruption caused by the outbreak.

But organisers indicated the race -- which had 22,500 entrants last year -- would still not go ahead because of safety fears.
