Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber dropped "Stuck With U" on Friday morning, a bubblegum-sweet ode to isolation with close ones. NEW YORK - Pop royalty Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber have teamed up for a duet to raise funds for the children of frontline workers fighting coronavirus. The pair dropped "Stuck With U" on Friday morning, a bubblegum-sweet ode to isolation with close ones. The now customary shot-from-home style music video features Grande snuggling in bed with her dog -- and twirling with a mystery man near the end of the song, who gossip outlets reported is her new real-estate agent boyfriend -- as Bieber canoodles with his wife Hailey Baldwin Bieber. The sugar-coated video also mashes up snippets submitted from fans and celebrities, including Kylie and Kendall Jenner, NBA star Stephen Curry and wife Ayesha, Chance the Rapper and Gwyneth Paltrow slow-dancing with her husband in a plaid bathrobe.

Proceeds from the song will go to the First Responders Children's Foundation, which provides grants and scholarships to the children of health care and emergency workers. The song reportedly is the first release to benefit charitable organisations from SB Projects, the entertainment and media company owned by Bieber and Grande's manager, Scooter Braun.
