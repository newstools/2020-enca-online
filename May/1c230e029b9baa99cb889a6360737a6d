Ahead of our move to lockdown level three traffic on the country's roads is predictably increasing and with it expected fatalities. “With more and more traffic on the road, it is about drivers now being more cautious,” Minnaar said. “We don’t want accidents such as this to happen, we don’t want people losing their lives unnecessarily. Drivers must be cautious, when they overtake, they must make sure that it is safe to overtake. They must not speed because it is speed is one factor that contributes to accidents every time.”
