File: As of Wednesday night, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Africa is 18, 003. JOHANNESBURG - South Africa has recorded the first death of an infant due to COVID-19. According to the health department, the two-day-old baby was born prematurely and therefore had lung difficulties which required ventilation support immediately after birth. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize says the mother had tested positive for COVID-19 and the child subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 as well. “It is important to appreciate the complexities of the underlying condition of prematurity,” Mkhize said. “We extend a special word of comfort to the mother of this child and salute the neonatologists, nurses and all allied and technical personnel who had the difficult task of caring for the neonate to the end.” READ: COVID-19: Survivors donate blood for testing The child was among 27 people who died in the last 24 hours, bringing the national death toll to 339.

My heart goes out to the family, colleagues and loved ones of this compatriot: we salute her for the contribution she has made to the fight against COVID-19.” The Department of Health says a total of 505, 861 tests have been conducted with 18, 252 done in the last 24 hour cycle. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
