Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says parents should allow their children to go to back school when they reopen next month. However, he has made it clear that parents have other options should they choose not to. He says the department plans to accommodate all parents, including those who want to do home-schooling. “We really want to accommodate everyone, we don’t want to take a route that says everyone must come back.

Unions and some community sectors are against the reopening. Lesufi says it is important for everyone to work together to ensure that children do not lose the academic year. “We are very cautious and we really want all of us to walk this journey together because we have never been here before and anyone who claims to have the know-how of this process, I don’t think that person would be honest.” - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
