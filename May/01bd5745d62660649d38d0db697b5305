At least 107 South Africans and foreigners staying at the Zithabiseni Resort in Groblersdal are also convinced it doesn’t meet health standards. On Sunday, a contingent of medical staff with privately-acquired tests was shown away.

"Zithabiseni initially had more rooms but most of the other rooms were disqualified and only 50 made the cut and these are the only 50 that were inspected by the department of public works and health that are meeting the minimum requirements," said Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency CEO Johannes Nobunga.

Those in quarantine also say they received small bottles of what appears to be dishwashing liquid to clean their entire accommodation. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
