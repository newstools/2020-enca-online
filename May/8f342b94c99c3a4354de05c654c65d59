File: Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan on Wednesday said that the government wanted to avoid a liquidation or fire sale of SAA assets, preferring to see SAA restructured into a new airline. JOHANNESBURG - The Labour Court in Johannesburg has ordered that SAA business rescue practitioners cannot go ahead with a full retrenchment process until they provide a proper business plan. The deadline for South African Airways (SAA) staff to agree to retrenchment terms has been suspended. The judge has found that unions are entitled to alternative relief sought and his order is to rectify the “act of unfairness” and said SAA BRPs must provide a plan before then act in retrenchment process.

SAA has been fighting for its survival since entering a form of bankruptcy protection in December, with its fortunes deteriorating further when the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to halt all commercial passenger flights and the government refused to provide further funding for turnaround efforts. The administrators seeking to rescue SAA had said on Sunday that unions must agree to severance terms by 8 May or a retrenchment agreement would be offered to all staff.

Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan on Wednesday said that the government wanted to avoid a liquidation or fire sale of SAA assets, preferring to see SAA restructured into a new airline. SAA on Friday said that it will continue to operate repatriation and cargo flights "during the month of May and beyond".
