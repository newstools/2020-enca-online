Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - SAA Business Rescue Practitioners have asked for yet another extension to submit their business rescue plan. The BRPs have been trying to finalise a rescue plan for months now. READ: Administrators deny SAA set to resume flying In their latest request for another extension, the BRPs say they need to consult with lenders, creditors, the shareholder and unions on the draft plan before the final one is submitted. The practitioners also mention their ongoing engagements with the shareholder which has asked the BRPs to consider a proposed restructuring plan to be possibly included in their draft plan. READ: SAA administrators can appeal retrenchments ruling On 15 May, the Business Rescue Practitioners presented before SCOPA on the work done so far, with Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan not impressed with the lack of work done so far. The Business Rescue Practitioners said last week South African Airways may not resume flights next month. This after the airline released a statement incorrectly suggesting that domestic services will resume by mid-June.
