Courtesy #DStv403 GENEVA - Nearly half of the entire global workforce is in immediate danger of having their livelihoods destroyed by the coronavirus pandemic, the International Labour Organization warned. The ILO said the risk fell on those workers in the informal economy, and three-quarters of them -- some 1.6 billion people -- were at risk in the second quarter of 2020. The UN agency said an expected further sharp decline in working hours due to the COVID-19 crisis, meant that these workers were in "immediate danger of having their livelihoods destroyed".

The 1.6 billion people stand in line to suffer "massive damage to their ability to earn a living," said ILO director-general Guy Ryder. "Staying home means losing their jobs, and without wages, they cannot eat," the report said.

It estimates that global working hours declined by 4.5 percent in the first quarter of 2020, compared with the last three months of 2019. "As the pandemic and the jobs crisis evolve, the need to protect the most vulnerable becomes even more urgent," said Ryder. The ILO said the worst-affected sectors would be accommodation and food services, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and real estate and business activities.
