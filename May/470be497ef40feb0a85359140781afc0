"During this difficult time, I hope you'll find some inspiration and joy in this film." The book of the same name by Obama -- America's first African American first lady and wife of the first black US president -- became a publishing sensation upon its release in 2018, selling more than two million copies in North America in two weeks.

The film chronicles Obama's "current experience -- where she is in this moment and the way she's reflecting on the entirety of her life, not just her years in the White House," said Hallgren.
