Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG – Sports, Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa says a total of 470 applicants from the sporting fraternity have applied for the COVID-19 relief fund. Mthethwa said 296 applicants have been approved and paid out while 174 have been declined. A total of 26 applicants have appealed with 10 being successful while three were rejected. In the Arts and Culture sector, 1,250 applicants were originally successful but the high number of rejected compelled the department to set up a process to give a platform to those who were not recommended. “We are concerned by the high number of people whose applications were declined by the adjudication committee and of particular importance to us, most of the people who were declined were coming from historically disadvantaged communities and you could see they desperately need this assistance," Mthethwa said. “So we decided that we need to look into the ways of ensuring that those who desperately need assistance do get it, within the confines of the legal precinct.” WATCH: Sport, Arts Minister briefing on COVID-19 Relief Fund South Africa will move into alert level 3 lockdown from 1 June. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday.
