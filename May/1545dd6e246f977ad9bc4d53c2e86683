Municipal commissioner Philip Sandberg fertilises the lawn in the Stadsparken park in Lund. STOCKHOLM - The Swedish university town of Lund spread foul-smelling chicken fertiliser in its main park to deter revellers holding spring celebrations as part of efforts to curb the coronavirus outbreak. City officials have asked residents to skip the traditional Walpurgis Eve celebrations and said they would also go a step further and take the opportunity to spread one tonne of chicken droppings in the park. "Well, chicken manure simply smells awful," Gustav Lundblad, chairman of the city's environment board, told AFP. "It's not very pleasant to sit around drinking beer in that smell," Lundblad added. Since the festivities -- which can attract up to 30,000 visitors -- are "spontaneous", the city cannot outright ban them but given the coronavirus outbreak, Lundblad said the city strongly wanted to avoid them. Lund is home to one of Sweden's largest universities and many of the municipality's some 125,000 inhabitants are students.
