If you broke the law during lockdown, your criminal record could be scrapped. JOHANNESBURG - If you broke the law during the lockdown, your criminal record could be scrapped. Deputy Justice Minister John Jeffery has told Parliament's Justice Committee the department is considering introducing a bill to deal with the issue.

Jeffery responded by saying the department is aware that so-called "COVID cases" will attract a criminal record if an admission of guilt fine is paid. It will be addressed through a Judiciary Matters bill. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
