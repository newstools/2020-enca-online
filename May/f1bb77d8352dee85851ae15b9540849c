Courtesy #DStv403 DURBAN - It was the first province in the country to report a COVID-19 case and for a long time, KwaZulu-Natal had the most number of deaths but it has seen a slight decline. Premier Sihle Zikalala says indications are that all districts in the province will move to Level 3 of the lockdown. "The province is currently as of today sitting at 10-percent in terms of active cases and has moved down to fourth position countrywide," Zikalala said. The premier has warned that a move to Level 3 would still require compliance. "There are strong indications that as KwaZulu-Natal all our regions may move to level 3. However, there is a caveat in order for that to happen and remain that way, everyone will have to comply with all the non-pharmaceutical approaches to preventing infections," Zikalala said.
