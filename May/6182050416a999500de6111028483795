So, we need to say please we've got quarantine facilities and isolation facilities so we need to have that discussion if you are not able to quarantine or isolate yourself and please make sure that in that environment you need to look after yourself,” Winde added. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
