Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - A Cape Town shop owner has laid a charge against the police for allegedly stealing money and goods from his shop. This was while they were pretending to check if he was complying with lockdown rules. The man says it did not happen just once, but twice in the space of two weeks. Mohammed Adam, a Somali national, who has been trading here for 16 years, says he stood by helplessly as the police offices helped themselves to chocolates and other treats. He claims he was also verbally and physically abused by the officers when he tried to tell them he had not been selling cigarettes since the lockdown.

The police say they can’t open a case against the police,” said Adam. He then went to the Police Investigative Directorate which told him to return to the police station to lay a charge. Two weeks later, Adam says he was shocked to see the same police arriving at his store. But this time they played it safe. “As you can see on the camera they delete it when they were coming in they delete it completely. They come in they take cigarette, they take chocolate, they take money,” said Adam.
