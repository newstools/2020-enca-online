Workers prepare the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with the Crew Dragon spacecraft attached for the scheduled liftoff at the Kennedy Space Center. FLORIDA - A new era in space begins on Wednesday with the launch by SpaceX of two NASA astronauts into space. If the bad weather clears, at 8.33pm (GMT) a SpaceX rocket with the new Crew Dragon capsule on top will take off from Launch Pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center, the same from which Neil Armstrong and his Apollo crewmates left for their historic journey to the Moon. Piloted by NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, it will head for the International Space Station.

The two men have been in quarantine for the past two weeks. Space Exploration Technologies Corp. was founded in 2002 by a Mars-obsessed entrepreneur determined to break the rules of the aerospace industry's game, Elon Musk. Gradually, it has earned the trust of the planet's largest space agency.

Two years later, NASA ordered the next step: to transport its astronauts there, starting in 2017, by adapting the Dragon capsule. The space agency paid more than $3-billion for SpaceX to design, build, test and operate its reusable capsule for six future space round trips. The development has experienced delays, explosions, and parachute problems -- but even so SpaceX has beaten the aviation giant Boeing to the punch.
