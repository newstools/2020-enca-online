Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG -The South African Human Rights Commission wants clarity from the Education Department about its decision to open schools to grades 7 and 12 pupils on 1 June. The commission says it will monitor a sample of schools across the country to establish whether they are ready to welcome children back. READ: Benefits for children going back to school outweigh risks: expert The SAHRC will also investigate issues including the safety of teachers and children, access to basic services, and the revised curriculum.
