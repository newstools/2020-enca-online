Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The difficulties at the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee continue to give the Sports Ministry sleepless nights. Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa is once again calling for Sascoc to get its house in order. It’s a plea that has become familiar in recent times, with little actual change to show for it. This has prompted Mthethwa to involve the IOC, but even that could prove to be an exercise in futility. READ: Sascoc on a mission to clean up damaged reputation Mthethwa is pushing for the Sascoc elections to take place as soon as possible. Voting was suspended in March, due to the COVID-19 pandemic but even before lockdown regulations came into effect, the organisation was in turmoil. A call for assistance to the International Olympic Committee didn’t go as planned. Instead, the IOC has insisted that Sascoc be left to address years of maladministration and poor governance issues on its own. “They felt that Sascoc should resolve its issues so I accepted what IOC said, but I did point to them that we will wait and see, whatever supported is needed from us we will give, but I’m not convinced that Sascoc board is focused in ensuring that sport wins in the country," Mthethwa said.

Sascoc is set to host its elections at its next Quadrennial General Meeting. A date is yet to be confirmed.
