DURBAN - The Lions have been dealt a massive deadline day blow after the union announced that Malcolm Marx will be leaving the union. Marx is expected to join Japan's Kubota Spears on a full-time basis. The Springboks hooker had previously spent the beginning of 2020 at the club on what was referred to as a sabbatical at the time.

Professional rugby players in the country had until midnight on Thursday to leave their existing contracts with their unions. It was a clause that was agreed upon by the SA Rugby Industry, South African Rugby Employers' Organisation and My Players last month as part of SA Rugby's efforts to cut costs in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.
