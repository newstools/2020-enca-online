It follows the alleged abduction, sexual assault, and torture of one of the party’s female MPs and two youth leaders. Joana Mamombe, Cecilia Chimbiri and Netsai Marova were allegedly kidnapped at a roadblock in Harare.

Families and lawyers spent 3 days trying to find the trio. They were eventually found dumped about 90 kilometres outside Harare. They are now recovering in hospital and say they were tortured and sexually assaulted. Police deny the three were in their custody. SA lockdown: Stranded Zimbabweans want out of SA Chamisa says the political situation is deteriorating and regional and international bodies must intervene. He says South Africa as a neighbour and President Cyril Ramaphosa as AU Chairperson must take the lead. “It’s so difficult that’s why we need the international community to help us, this is why the United Nations must help us, this why SADC and AU should help us, President Ramaphosa please lead us, help us to help ourselves. We are going to stand as Zimbabweans, but ultimately we need an international hand,” he said. Amnesty International called the incident alarming, saying if they were taken by security forces it is a crime under international law.
