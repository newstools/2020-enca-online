Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Almost one-million people in Johannesburg need food aid during the lockdown. The City of Joburg is planning to use the South African Social Security Agency’s data to find out those who are not on the welfare system. Mayor Geoff Makhubo says if ever there is unemployment, Johannesburg would be the hardest hit.

"Our expectation is with lots of people getting unemployed because of this coronavirus, we expect that people will be moving to the urban areas, especially Johannesburg and Gauteng broadly because they feel like survival is better in the urban areas", he said. Makhubo says the city cannot afford to feed all the needy. "We can't afford all that but with the interventions from national government of introducing R350 per person and augmenting the child care grant, it goes  long way in reducing the number in need of food." - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
