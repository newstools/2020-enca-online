The Flower Supermoon rises over Curitiba, Brazil. The supermoon is visible as the full moon coincides with the satellite in its closest approach to Earth, which makes it appear brighter and larger than other full moons. JOHANNESBURG - The last supermoon for 2020 is visible on Thursday night. The term 'supermoon' refers to a full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest to Earth in a given orbit. This makes it look bigger and brighter. In a typical year, there can be three or four supermoons and they are times of celebration for various religions. This is the last supermoon for this year. The May full moon is "only" 361,184 kilometres from Earth.
