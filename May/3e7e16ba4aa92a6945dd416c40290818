Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The South African Democratic Teachers Union says its members will not be going back to work on Monday. Sadtu insists that necessary health and safety measures have not yet been put in place. "Sadtu has been very clear and it is our view that we have very strong moral obligation to send a message to our members that we do not believe that all the minimum requirements that we have set before the department of Basic Education have been met and that the system is ready to receive them back to work", said Sadtu's Xolani Fakude. SA lockdown: Schools to remain closed in May The basic education minister announced on 30 April that management teams would report to schools on Monday while teachers would return on May 18. "What we know is that on 30th of April, the minister of basic education went into a social contract with all South Africans and said that certain things are going to met by the employer in time for us to go back to work. Right now, we do not have any evidence as a union that, that has been met and that is why we are saying our members should stay at home and stay safe until we advise them otherwise." Fakude says the union is open to engagement with the basic education officials in order to find the best solution for everyone. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
