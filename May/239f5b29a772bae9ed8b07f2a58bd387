READ: Western Cape police to track COVID-19 cases Rhodes factory workers have protested about their working conditions during the lockdown period. But the company says it's doing all it can. "There have been times where it allowed people to stand closer than 1,5 meters but that’s been changed and the same with masks. Initially, we provided masks for transport but that’s now been implemented in the workplace as well," said Rhodes Food Group CEO, Bruce Henderson. The Labour Department inspected the Tulbagh site last month and approved mitigation measures.

About 750 employees have been tested on-site and the premises were deep-cleaned after each COVID-19 case was identified.
