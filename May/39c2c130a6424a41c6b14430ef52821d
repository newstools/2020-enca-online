File: The testing began more than three years ago in seven countries -- including the United States, Brazil, Thailand, and South Africa -- and looked at men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women, most of them under age 30. WASHINGTON - Injecting people with a new, experimental drug every eight weeks provides better protection against HIV than daily pills that have revolutionised the fight against AIDS, US government researchers reported. The National Institutes of Health released the preliminary results of a major clinical trial involving a drug called cabotegravir. The testing began more than three years ago in seven countries -- including the United States, Brazil, Thailand, and South Africa -- and looked at men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women, most of them under age 30.

Another clinical trial focusing on women is underway. For now, the only medication approved for HIV prevention is a drug cocktail called PrEP, which stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. In the US, it has been marketed under the brand names Truvada and Descovy. HIV-free people who te PrEP daily see their risk of infection from unprotected sex reduced by 99 percent, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The results released stem from a trial involving more than 4,500 people. Half were injected with cabotegravir and took PrEP placebos, while the other half received a placebo injection and real PrEP pills. So everybody taking part in the trial was treated with either cabotegravir or PrEP.
