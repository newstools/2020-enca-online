File: Tokyo 2020 president Yoshiro Mori said there is "absolutely no" chance of postponing the Games beyond their rescheduled 2021 opening. TOKYO - Olympics chief Thomas Bach said 2021 was the "last option" for holding the delayed Tokyo Games on Thursday, stressing that postponement cannot go on forever. Bach told the BBC that he agreed with Japan's stance that the Games will have to be cancelled if the coronavirus pandemic isn't under control by next year. READ: Impossible to delay Olympics again, says Tokyo chief In March, the Tokyo 2020 Olympics were postponed to July 23, 2021, as the coronavirus spread across the globe, killing hundreds of thousands of people and making international sport impossible. "Quite frankly, I have some understanding for (Japan's position) because you cannot forever employ 3,000, or 5,000, people in an organising committee," the International Olympic Committee president said.

"You cannot have the athletes being in uncertainty, you cannot have so much overlapping with a future Olympic Games."
