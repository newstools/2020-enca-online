Based in Cape Town, Lungile was a fearless journalist. A loving husband and a magnificent father. Tom loved to sing, smile and taking selfies. He was larger than life, a man with mischief in his eyes and joy in his heart. READ: eMedia Investments mourns the loss of top cameraman Lungile made a mark wherever he went. Just days after he died, a local artist paid tribute to him by projecting the images onto a building in Cape Town. We will never hear his voice again. We will never see his smile but he will live in our hearts because that's where he belongs. Goodbye brother, we love you and we will miss you.
