JOHANNESBURG - Virtual gatherings are the place to be these days -- from company meetings to religious services to video call birthday parties. One South African student has taken it a step further creating a virtual choir during the lockdown. Mangaliso Bhekizulu Ngwane created a YouTube video of the choir -- with over a hundred people from nine countries -- performing Hide Me Now.
