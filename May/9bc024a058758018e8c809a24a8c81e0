File: Lesotho PM Thomas Thabane told AFP that he intended to hand in his resignation to the country's supreme traditional leader, King Letsie III, on Wednesday. MASERU - Lesotho's beleaguered prime minister can be sacked by the king if he does not resign before May 22, his party said. Prime Minister Thomas Thabane had told AFP that he intended to hand in his resignation to the country's supreme traditional leader, King Letsie III, on Wednesday. But on Thursday, the prime minister's spokesman Relebohile Moyeye said he had not "received information that the PM has resigned".

His own All Basotho Convention (ABC) party said the king can fire Thabane as he has not quit. "The constitution says if the prime minister has lost support in parliament, the speaker will advise His Majesty," ABC chairman Samuel Rapapa told AFP.

"We are now expecting the king to remove the prime minister. As to when, we don’t know," Rapapa said. Thabane, whose five-year term was due to run until 2022, said he felt ready to leave and was tying up loose ends to ensure his retirement was "as smooth as possible". His party has nominated Finance Minister Moeketsi Majoro as his successor.
