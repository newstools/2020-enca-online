Nafupa president Muzi Hlengwa said those that are currently open are doing reburials.
"They identified four sites where they can use as cemeteries. One is in Verulam which is about 849 hectares that will last us more than 100 years. While authorities have been calling for more cremations, some funeral directors say this is not a viable option for communities because there are only six facilities in the city, with four of them being privately-owned.
eThekwini says right now it's busy with the task of flattening the COVID-19 curve. It says it will outline the city's plan for the worst-case scenario at the appropriate time. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
