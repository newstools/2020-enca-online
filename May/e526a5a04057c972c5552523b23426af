Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - ANC top brass has asked President Cyril Ramaphosa to rein in finance minister Tito Mboweni. Last week Mboweni went public with disagreements with cabinet colleagues. First, he declared he didn't support a continued ban on tobacco sales during the lockdown and later he distanced himself from the executive's decision to reserve COVID-19 tourism relief funds for black-owned small businesses. READ: ANC concerned over Mboweni's public utterances ANC treasurer-general Paul Mashatile has confirmed to eNCA that the party's top six officials discussed Mboweni's conduct on Monday. 'We did discuss that and our view is that colleagues must work together. We know that in any organisation, including cabinet, people will have different views but at the end of the day once a decision has been taken we want everyone to own up to it", said Mashatile. He says the president has been asked to speak to Mboweni. "He was going to be spoken to by the president, to say, what he did was wrong and I guess if the behaviour continues after you have been spoken to and advised then the organisation might take you through a disciplinary process."
