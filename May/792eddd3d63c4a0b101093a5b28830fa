Majority of unions representing SAA workers have rejected the business rescue practitioners' proposal to wind down the airline. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The South African Cabin Crew Association (Sacca) is confident that SAA can be successfully resuscitated. The union's president Zazi Nsibanyoni-Mugambi says the consultation forum, which includes different unions, has proposed a plan which they hope will revitalise the national carrier. "What we want to see out of it is fit for purpose leadership that has aviation skills which are necessary as we get out of COVID-19 pandemic. READ: Restructure on the cards at SAA We need to start to see people looking at the leasing costs, the maintenance costs, the fuel costs and capitalise where we are on cargo. The BRP's have not done that and they have been at the helm for five months. So we have put various options in place including a strategic equity partner we can't run away at some point we will need some partner to help with the capitalisation of the SAA", she said. Meanwhile, the union is accusing SAA's business rescue practitioners of worrying about their own pockets. READ: Millions more needed for SAA The union claims they have been paid about R60-million but there is nothing to show for it. "They have received R30-million each, as we have been reliably been informed and as you would know, initially they had asked for R2-billion from the shareholder and that amount subsequently shot up to R4-billion. READ: SAA lost more R10.5bn in the past two years: report The shareholder then went above that call and gave them R5.5-billion, for five months that is bot excessive and we are saying we need to investigate where all that money went to."
