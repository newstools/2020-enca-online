Minister of Sport, Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa JOHANNESBURG - Entertainment production companies can resume work under tough new regulations, according to Sports, Arts, and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa. He says that some safety measures need to be implemented immediately. 'Sanitising of the environment needs to occur before the shoot commences, during each shoot day and after wrap each day. There must be dedicated cleaning staff to sanitise and clean bathroom spaces on regular rotation throughout the day. A daily register of all persons granted access to the set with details of their daily temperatures must be compiled", said Mthethwa. WATCH: Sport, Arts Minister briefing on COVID-19 Relief Fund Mthethwa briefed the media on Monday following the announcement of a R150-million Relief Fund. He says the lack of structure and organisation in the entertainment sector has made it difficult for the government to assist during this time. "From the side of Arts and Culture, we do not have the kind of federations which we have in sport but we do have national organisations and we will have conversations with them", he added. According to the department, 5,000 applications from the arts and culture sector and 300 from sport were received. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
