JOHANNESBURG - Government has responded to criticism from Ministerial Advisory Committee member Professor Glenda Gray. Gray called government's risk-adjusted COVID-19 strategy as "unscientific" but the health department's acting Director-General Dr Anban Pillay says her comments are surprising" since it was not in her or the ministerial advisory committee's jurisdiction. "In the case, specifically of the lockdown, there has been no advice from the advisory committee since that was not a mandate of the advisory committee. COVID-19: SA cases increase to 15,515, death toll at 264 That is broadly a government responsibility of a number of government departments since this requires an integrated response on how we implement a lockdown and how a lockdown is lifted", said Pillay. He said members of the advisory council raised their concerns during a meeting on Saturday night. "For part of the meeting I did attend, I heard the views MAC members that had spoken out and those members that had spoken out spoke about matters that they had not provided advice on previously, I think they were talking about personal concerns linked to the regulations." Last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that lockdown regulations will be eased and see most parts of the country move to Level 3 restrictions. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
