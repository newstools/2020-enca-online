READ: Restaurant owners left with bitter taste Government is allowing restaurants to operate but only for deliveries. "We've humble and we're thankful for opening up delivery but it's just over 10% of our total business, it is almost like taking our eight million customers a month and saying go use delivery," said McDonald's South Africa CEO Greg Solomon. "It’s been sweet and sour deliveries allowed us to sort of oil the wheels and used to operating in an environment where we need to use PPE and have limited hours. “The revenue has been reasonably pleasing but it's our smallest and least profitable channel. “If government doesn't continue to open parts of the economy and our business we cannot sustain delivery for much longer where we sit right now."
