NASA astronauts Bob Behnken (R) and Doug Hurley (L) will get another chance to blast off to space on Saturday. FLORIDA - After a day of suspense, SpaceX's landmark launch to the International Space Station -- the first crewed mission to blast off from US soil in almost a decade -- was scrubbed on Wednesday due to fears of a lightning strike.With NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley strapped into the Crew Dragon capsule, the launchpad platform retracted and rocket fueling underway, SpaceX made the call to abort.

"We had just simply too much electricity in the atmosphere," NASA chief Jim Bridenstine said later. "There wasn't really a lightning storm or anything like that, but there was a concern that if we did launch it could actually trigger lightning," he added.
