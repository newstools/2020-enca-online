Fashion designer Yr Johannsdottir poses for a photo wearing one of her masks. REYKJAVIK - Throughout the coronavirus pandemic the effectiveness of masks has been under debate, but Icelandic designer Yrurari's knitted face coverings aren't so much to stop airborne droplets as to keep people at a distance by displaying scary tongues or fangs. The sometimes bizarre creations were inspired by the films and TV shows Yr Johannsdottir, the designer's real name, watched during self-imposed confinement in March and April. "The idea is that the masks would be 'scary' because of the rule of keeping the distance," Johannsdottir told AFP.

The most elaborate creations require up to ten hours of work to complete.

While her masks have enjoyed popularity on social media networks, the young Icelandic designer has no intention of mass-producing them. "I don’t want to make too many either, I want them to just be like they are for the moment I made them."
