Police are still searching for 37 illegal immigrants who escaped from the Lindela Repatriation Centre in Krugersdorp. The inmates escaped on Sunday afternoon after rival gangs rioted inside the centre. It appears the centre was understaffed when the breakout occurred. #Day41ofLockdown JOHANNESBURG - Security guards at the Lindela Repatriation Centre have blamed dilapidated buildings and understaffing for an increase in escapes. 37 illegal immigrants broke out on Sunday during a riot that was instigated by rival gangs. Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi inspected the centre on Wednesday and blamed the guards for the escapes. “They had a squabble with their workers who knocked off at 2 and the escape happened at 5," said Motsoaledi.

It's still not clear who’s to blame for the escapes, or whether Lindela will be renovated to fix security risks. But without additional guards and equipment, more riots and escapes are highly likely.
