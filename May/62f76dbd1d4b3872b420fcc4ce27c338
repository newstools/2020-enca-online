Buses and taxis have been ordered to carry fewer passengers at a time, and ensure strict hygiene control. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula says public transport will operate again during level 4 lockdown, but not during the nightly curfew. Mbalula briefed the media on COVID-19 lockdown regulations and directives related to transport on Friday. READ: Revised level four lockdown regulations "All road-based public transport services are permitted to operate from 05:00 until 19:00, with a one hour grace period in the afternoon to complete their trips and drop off passengers", said Mbalula. He says taxis must continue to limit passenger numbers to 70% of their capacity. Masks and sanitisation are compulsory for all commuters. Meanwhile, freight transport is the only rail service that will be allowed to operate fully during alert level 4. The Gautrain will run from 5am to noon, and 3pm to 8pm. "Gautrain operations will be gradually reintroduced in all their rail-based services, covering eight of their nine stations. There will be no airport services for Gautrain. An appropriate load factor will be applied by all operators based on their seating and standing arrangements", said Mbalula. Trains operated by Prasa will not be available until alert level 3. Mbalula says the only people who can fly are those performing essential work. Other domestic flight restrictions will be eased only during alertÂ level 3 of the lockdown and full resumption of local and international flights will take place at level 2.
