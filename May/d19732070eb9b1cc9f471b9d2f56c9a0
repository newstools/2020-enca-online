WASHINGTON - The John Deere Classic, in position to be the first US PGA Tour event to be played with spectators since the coronavirus pandemic, has been cancelled. Multiple media outlets had reported the event, scheduled for July 9-12 in Silvis, Illinois, would not be staged this year. "As a result of this decision, the PGA Tour announced that it will fill the week vacated by the John Deere Classic with a new tournament," the tour said in a statement, adding that details on the venue would be forthcoming in the near future.
