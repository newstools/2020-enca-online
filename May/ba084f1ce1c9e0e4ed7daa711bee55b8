It’s called Lockdown Bozza. The mountains of regulations are difficult to understand and downright confusing at the best of times. The app is proving a hit with South Africans wading their way through this unprecedented time. READ: South Africa enters into level 4 lockdown “We knew we needed to create something. We knew South Africans would use it but we could never have anticipated the response that we’ve gotten," said Lockdown Bozza co-founder Ahren Posthumus. "But at least we knew it would be something useful to us." The website is technically called a progressive web app, which is the next generation of applications. LIST: Revised level four lockdown regulations "What’s really cool is it’s a fully-fledged application that you can install on your phone but you don’t have to get it from an app store," said Posthumus. "You can install it directly on your phone from the website and it supports any device. It really is the next generation of applications." - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
