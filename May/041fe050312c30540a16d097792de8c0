Inter Milan's Belgian forward Romelu Lukaku celebrates after scoring his second goal during the Italian Serie A football match Napoli vs Inter Milan on January 6, 2020 at the San Paolo stadium in Naples. MILAN - Italian Sports Minister Vincenzo Spadafora insisted that Serie A football will only resume when "the safety of all" is guaranteed, saying he found the intense debate "excessive". "If the championship resumes, as we all hope, it will be because we'll have taken the appropriate measures and protocols to resume in complete safety, for all," Spadafora told the Italian Senate. Italian teams returned to individual training after a two-month lockdown on May 4, with group sessions set for May 18 under very strict conditions.

"Someone asked why a supermarket does not close if the cashier is positive while if a player is, the whole team is sent to quarantine," said Spadafora. "Because in football it is not possible to keep a distance with players having to run and mark each other, which does not happen in the supermarket.

Spadafora added: "I'm aware of the passion surrounding football and the importance of the sector, but I find the debate around football at a time like this excessive." Italy has been one of the hardest-hit countries by the COVID-19 pandemic with nearly 31,000 deaths.
