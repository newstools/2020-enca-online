The union is calling on people to adhere to COVID-19 safety protocols to help curb the spread of the Coronavirus. "What we would like to see is society take charge of controlling the spread of the virus," said DENOSA's Simon Hlungwani. "We want to see the preparedness of the health system in general, to making sure we have available staffing, but we know we have challenges in our country," he adds.

The union's general secretary, Zola Saphetha, says health workers are not prepared for the second wave. "We are seeing something contrary that has been perpetuated to our society as we observe the impact of the second wave in summer," he says. "Before the second wave, there was an assumption that resulted in complacency as if the virus was going away." According to the union, society is not taking the virus seriously as they continue having mass gatherings.
