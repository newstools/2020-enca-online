Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Shareholder advocacy group Just Share has slammed Standard Bank's Fossil Fuels Financing Policy. ItÂ sets out how it will fund coal, oil and gas projects. The bank explains that it will only make funds available to clients who commit to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. It says it won't fund any new coal-fired power plant projects but will continue to provide finance to thermal coal mining projects and companies that meet certain criteria. But Just Share says it's not good enough and called the policy contradictory.
