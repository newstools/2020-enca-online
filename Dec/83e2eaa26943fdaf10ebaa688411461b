Sadtu and Afriforum are back in court. They want Basic Education Minister, Angie Motshekga's decision for an impending matric rewrite of the physical science paper 2 and mathematics paper 2 exams which were leaked to be halted. PRETORIA - Judgment in the matric rewrite legal challenge will be handed down on Friday. Afriforum and other organisations want to stop the Basic Education Department's decision to rewrite the
leaked matric maths and physical science papers. READ: One person arrested in connection with matric exam leaks Afriforum represents four pupils and wants the courts to allow the marking of their scripts and those not involved in the alleged irregularity regarding the leaked papers. Sadtu's legal representative referred to the Matric exam leak that occurred in 2016 and said that leak also occurred on Whatsapp but pupils were not forced to rewrite the exam. The Department argues that the rewrite will protect the integrity of the National Senior Certificate. Advocate Chris Erasmus, representing the state, said without a rewrite, the academic year would be lost. The investigation into the incident will reportedly be concluded in February 2021.
