The Usuthu's former striker was made permanent coach at the beginning of the season after doing well as interim coach in the second half of last season. He replaced then sacked Cavin Johnson who is now Pitso Mosimane's assistant at Egyptian giants Al Ahly. Dlamini leaves AmaZulu in position eleven with six points from six outings having one a solitary match. The 36-year-old will be re-assigned to the role of coach within the club's development ranks. Assistant coach Allan Freese will step in as interim coach while the club evaluates a way forward. Bafana Bafana's record goalscorer Benni McCarthy is tipped to take over despite owner Sandile Zungu dismissing the rumours last week.
