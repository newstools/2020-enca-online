With COVID-19 and strict lockdown regulations in place, things will be done differently this year. The initiation season was supposed to begin in June but when the pandemic hit, had to take a back seat.

Acting chair of the National House of Traditional Leaders, Langa Mavuso, said so far things are going as planned.

"Things are happening in the province along those lines to ensure that there is compliance with the requirements in terms of health screening," said Eastern Cape Cogta MEC Xolile Nqatha. The Eastern Cape is the only province carrying out initiations and the season is set to end just before pupils head back to school. * eNCA's Nceba Ntlanganiso reports.
