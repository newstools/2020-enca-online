"On Monday, a 39-year-old woman was serving coffee. When she asked Mr Sredojevic whether he took his coffee with sugar, he said no, but said he wanted a different type of sugar pointing at the woman's private parts," said Ncakane. Later the same day, when the woman came again to serve him coffee, he touched the woman's buttocks, explained the official. A complaint was laid with the police leading to Friday's court appearance.
