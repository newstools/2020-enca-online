Jaco van der Walt has just become eligible on residency grounds. AFP/Thibaud Moritz LONDON -Â Edinburgh fly-half Jaco van der Walt will make his Scotland debut in their Autumn Nations Cup finale away to Ireland on Saturday after being named as one of six changes by coach Gregor Townsend. The 26-year-old has just become eligible on residency grounds and has completed a spell in quarantine on his return from getting married in his native South Africa. Scotland captain Stuart Hogg is set to win his 80th cap, with Saracens centre Duncan Taylor making his first Test start since the 2019 World Cup for what will be a third-fourth place play-off encounter. Scotland, who did not play last week after their match against Fiji was cancelled due to coronavirus in the Pacific Islanders' camp, will be looking for their first win in Ireland since 2010. "It will be a tough challenge over in Ireland, given the quality of our opposition and how they will be looking to end 2020 on a positive note," Townsend said. "Being able to bring back (prop) Rory Sutherland after his recent injury is a real boost, and it's great to involve Blair (Cowan) and Huw (Jones) for the first time this season. "If they get on the field, 39 players will have had opportunities to play over the past five games, which underlines the current player depth throughout Scottish rugby and shows the competition there is for places now in this Scotland team."
