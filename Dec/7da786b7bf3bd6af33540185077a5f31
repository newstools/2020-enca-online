World Cup holders South Africa will face Ireland as well as Scotland and an outfit from Asia/Pacific and a further European nation in Pool B. "It's exciting, really, to know who your RWC pool opponents will be for the 2023 tournament in France," Springboks captain Siya Kolisi said. "For now, we have to turn our attention to the massive challenge the British and Irish Lions will bring next year – there is huge anticipation, both at home and in the UK, for what promises to be another memorable Lions series in South Africa," he added. Wales, who lost to the Springboks in the 2019 semi-finals, are in Pool C with two-time Webb Ellis trophy holders Australia as well as Fiji, a European team and the winner of the final qualifying tournament. England take on Japan, who hosted the last World Cup in 2019, and Argentina, who beat New Zealand for the first time in their history in November. A qualifier each from Oceania and the Americas round out a competitive-looking Pool D. "It's a great pool to be a part of," England captain Owen Farrell said. "Obviously with the way that Japan and Argentina are going at the minute, some of the rugby that has been played over the last few years by them both, obviously it's going to be a tough pool." Italy and two qualifiers, one from the Americas and another from Africa, make up the rest of Pool A alongside the All Blacks and France.
