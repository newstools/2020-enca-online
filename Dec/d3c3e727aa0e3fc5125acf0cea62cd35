Courtesy #DStv403 DURBAN - After finding out his status and overcoming the emotional impact of it, Sakhile Xaba started an organisation that visits townships and educates communities about HIV/Aids. Xaba has been living with HIV since 2003. He says when he first learned of his status, it was hard to accept and he was in denial for three years. "You just need to come to terms with that and tell people that this is me and this is what I’m living with and you need to also change and focus on your health," he said.

Finally, he decided to tell his family and they offered him so much support, he was able to move forward with his life. A few years later, Xaba decided to launch his organisation to help others going through the same thing he went through.

If you know your status it's better and you will live a healthy life and you won’t be stressed," he said. "Get tested and if you are positive, please start your treatment as soon as possible." Xaba says his wish now is for the country to reach a point where there is zero transmission. * eNCA's Lethiwe Mdluli reports.
