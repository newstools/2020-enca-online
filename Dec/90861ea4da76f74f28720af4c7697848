AFP/Michael Reaves MIAMI - World number one Ko Jin-young fired five birdies in a five-under-par 67 on Friday to seize a one-stroke lead over Kim Sei-young and Lexi Thompson in the LPGA Tour Championship. South Korea's Ko, playing just her fourth LPGA event of the pandemic-disrupted season, had a 36-hole total of nine-under par 135. With a $1.1-million winner's prize on offer, Ko could end up topping the 2020 money list with a victory despite making so few starts. She wasn't even assured a place in the Tour Championship until she tied for second in the US Women's Open last week.

"World ranking, my opinion is it's just (doing) little things to play golf," she said. "So if I play good I can do world ranking No. 1 still. If not and then she plays good she can do it ... it doesn't really matter." Ko, three adrift to start the day, gained steam with birdies at the sixth and 10th, then picked up three strokes in the space of four holes with birdies at the 14th, 15th and 17th. She drained a birdie bomb at the 15th for a share of the lead and was alone in front after a birdie at the par-five 17th. "I want to go bogey-free (the) next two days, so I'm looking forward the weekend," she said.
