Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN -  Sophia Sultan is drowning in debt with a water bill of R1.6-million. The pensioner is going through deep waters with the City of Cape Town. "I have been having endless sleepless nights and nightmares," she said. "It has really stressed me out and it is really overwhelming.” Sultan said she's had countless meetings with city officials over the years to try and explain that she had tenants in her house.

Sultan says she's spent tens of thousands of rand seeking help to resolve the matter and even hired a company to check for leaks. But despite her pleas to the city, she says bills have continued pouring in along with letters of demand. The only thing the City of Cape Town is saying is that it's aware of the matter and that it has been escalated for urgent attention. It's added that the office of the ombudsman is conducting an investigation. * eNCA's Ayesha Ismail reports.
