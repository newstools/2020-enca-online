Courtesy #DStv403  JOHANNESBURG - The Edenvale Lions Academy has taken advantage of the chaos that reigns in South African basketball. Run by a two-person team, the duo have managed to find players and sponsors as they continue to increase their footprint in the sport. With seven years’ experience and 60 players on the board, the academy’s ultimate goal is to produce players for the international basketball market. The academy is planning to host its annual The Vale Tournament next year. With some sponsorship on board, it’s aiming to increase the competition’s prize money to R1-million by 2022. * eNCA's Hloni Mtimkulu reports.
