According to the Department of Justice and Correctional Services, petty crimes can be characterised as crimes of need that are non-violent in nature, like shoplifting, trespassing and phone snatching.
Crime experts say it's not going to get any better this festive season.

"What we've seen over the past few weeks especially has been an increase in cellphone snatching."
Police say crooks are always hard at work to find new ways to commit crimes.

"Because it's so congested you only realise later that you're only left with your handbag straps."
The public is urged to be vigilant and walk in large groups as crime is expected to peak in the run-up to Christmas. * eNCA's Nkosazana Dambuza reports.
