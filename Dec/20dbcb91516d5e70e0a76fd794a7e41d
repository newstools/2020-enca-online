Up to the last week, the increase was mainly in the Eastern and Western Cape in specific districts, however, the minister has said the country is experiencing infection numbers that indicate a second wave nationally. Mkhize said the age distribution has also shown a different pattern from the norm. The age group 15-19 years showed the highest number of cases over the past two days, a trend the minister says is due to young people attending large gatherings that show a lack of social distancing, mask-wearing and other public intervention strategies. Mkhize said the national government is concerned about how the country will respond to the coming festive season.
