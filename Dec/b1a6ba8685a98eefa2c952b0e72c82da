Courtesy #DStv403  CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape’s emergency services have landed a helping hand of drones. They will be used to locate and identify mountain fires and assist firefighting crews put out fires. “The drone is going to aid in getting quicker to the patient, finding them and making the whole rescue operation a lot sooner," said Fabian Higgins, EMS Flight Operations Manager.

Western Cape Health authorities say they plan to expand the use of these drones, even in remote rural areas as well as the Garden Route. * eNCA’s Nobesuthu Hejana reports.
