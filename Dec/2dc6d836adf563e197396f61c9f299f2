Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - A twist in the case of murdered wine farmer Stefan Smit as a family member of one of the accused has turned state's witness. In addition, the victim’s widow Zurenah Smit and her two co-accused now face even more charges in connection with his killing. Smit and private investigator Derek Sait are currently applying for bail. They and Steven Damon were arrested in the past week and charged with Stefan’s murder on the Louiesenhof wine farm last year. Damon has elected not to apply for bail. Smit and Sait have now also been charged with the theft and illegal possession of firearms and ammunition. Smit’s legal team says she suffers from medical conditions and wants to be hospitalised until her next court appearance. She'll be in the dock alongside Sait on Monday on the firearm charges. The bail applications will continue on Wednesday. * eNCA's Nadine Theron reports.
