That's the stern warning from the Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association to the state capture inquiry's chairperson, Justice Raymond Zondo. READ: Zondo issues another summons for Zuma The MKMVA was reacting to the commission's move to lay a criminal complaint against the former president after leaving commission proceedings without permission. "Any person summoned to attend and to give evidence before the commission is required to do so," Zondo said before instructing the secretary of the commission to lay a criminal complaint with the police. "We are all equal before the law." READ: Zondo: Zuma walking out of state capture inquiry 'a serious matter' MKMVA President Kebby Maphatsoe said "we respect the Zondo Commission and DCJ Zondo and we said we want to request that DCJ Zondo withdraw that letter that lays charges against [former] president Jacob Zuma. "In the event that Jacob Zuma is arrested, there is a high risk of civil unrest that will happen which would be unable for the government to control." Maphatsoe said the advice originates from his expertise in security matters.
