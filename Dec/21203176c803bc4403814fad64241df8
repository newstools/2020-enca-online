He said health facilities there are under a lot of pressure due to a rise in COVID-19 cases as well as non-COVID-related issues.

"The most severe and critical shortage is in critical care: that's ICU and high care and earlier this week, there have been cases where there is virtually no capacity left between the private and public sector for critical care in Cape Town."
