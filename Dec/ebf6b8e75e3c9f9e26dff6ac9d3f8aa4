AFP/David Gray SYDNEY - Ravindra Jadeja was ruled out of the final two games of India's Twenty20 series against Australia with a concussion after controversy marred the opening clash in Canberra. The allrounder was hit on the helmet by a rising delivery from Mitchell Starc during his match-turning 44 not out on Friday evening. He did not get immediate medical treatment but was examined at the innings break and replaced by substitute Yuzvendra Chahal, who then took three crucial wickets as India won by 11 runs. "The diagnosis was confirmed based on a clinical assessment in the dressing room during the innings break by the BCCI medical team," the Indian cricket board said in a statement. "He will not take any further part in the ongoing T20 series." Seamer Shardul Thakur was added to the squad as cover. The substitution was controversial as Jadeja had earlier suffered a leg strain and received extensive treatment, casting doubt over whether he would be able to bowl, before being withdrawn for concussion. Australia coach Justin Langer was furious, remonstrating with match referee David Boon, apparently unhappy that Chahal, a specialist bowler, was allowed to take the place of an allrounder. Concussion substitutes were introduced to international cricket last year in a bid to improve player welfare. It allows teams to replace someone with a "like for like" player, approved by the match referee.
