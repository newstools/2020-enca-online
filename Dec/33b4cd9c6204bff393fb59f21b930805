The family does intend to take legal action after his tombstone in Heroes Acre outside Durban was vandalised. The tombstone was unveiled just a few weeks ago. READ: Senzo Meyiwa murder case postponed to March 2021 The family's spokesperson Siya Meyiwa said, "We were quite disturbed as a family and the municipality will open the case and we will open a case as well against the act that took place." "Based on the assessment, we think it is an act of just vandals of people that had no idea who Senzo was. We think it is the act of thuggery and we don’t think someone targeted this tombstone." Meyiwa was shot dead in October 2014 at Kelly Khumalo's home. At least five people are on trial for his murder.
