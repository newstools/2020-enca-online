Both maths paper two and physical science paper two have been leaked. READ: Sadtu to challenge matric rewrite The Basic Education Department said it must protect the integrity of the National Senior Certificate, hence matrics will be rewriting those two papers. AfriForum will be assisting matric pupils with an urgent court application. They plan to reverse the decision by Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga that two leaked exam papers be rewritten. READ: Education department expected matric rewriting pushback "Legally, we are going to oppose it based on the regulations of the department, that if a student has committed no irregularities with regards to the exam paper and has not received any benefit from the irregularities, then that exam paper should be marked and those marks should be released," said AfriForum's Natasha Venter. Venter said AfriForum takes the department's concerns into account but said an expert statement would indicate alternate methods of identifying potential culprits. The organisation will be in court on Wednesday to argue its case.
