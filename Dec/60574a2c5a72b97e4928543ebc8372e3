"We will continue to work closely with all relevant parties to make the right decisions in the appropriate timeframes," he added. If the Sydney clash goes ahead, a problem could be getting the players to Brisbane for the final Test a week later after Queensland state announced Sunday it was effectively closing its border to Sydney. The second Test starts in Melbourne on Boxing Day and back-to-back Tests there could be an option. Otherwise, they could return to Adelaide, where Australia won the opening Test by eight wickets on Saturday, or host two in a row in Brisbane.
