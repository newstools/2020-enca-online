Professor Shabir Madhi Professor of Vaccinology at Wits University spoke with eNCA's Jeremy Maggs. Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Professor Shabir Madhi said it's surprising that South Africans are among the least willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The 15-nation survey was conducted by Ipsos and the World Economic Forum. READ: COVID-19 in SA: When can we expect the vaccine? It revealed that only 53 percent of people say they would get the shot. READ: What we know about COVID-19 vaccines and side effects Professor Madhi explained why some people may be reluctant to take the vaccine.
He said, "it does come as somewhat of a surprise because the history of vaccines in South Africa, in terms of uptake, is that most people have been pro-vaccine in terms of recognising its public health value. I think, what we're experiencing now is a lot of uncertainty with the regards to the COVID-19 vaccine. That being said, even in the United State before vaccination program, the number of people in the US that indicated they would be vaccinated was roughly the same percentage -- about 55 percent a few months ago, over time that number actually changed." Professor Madhi credited the attitude change with people understanding the impact of COVID-19 as well as seeing regulatory authorities approval of the vaccines.
