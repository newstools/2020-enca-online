So what does the second wave of infections mean, as we prepare for the festive season? #eNCA Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - One expert says the second COVID-19 wave is a result of too many South Africans failing to take necessary steps to protect themselves. Over 6,000 South Africans have tested positive for the virus in the latest reporting period and the death toll keeps rising. "When you look at the specific stages of lockdown and you look at levels 2 and 1, there was evidence that we were in control of this COVID-19 outbreak," says Adrian Puren from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases. "We have seen in the Easter Cape and Kwazulu-Natal where we have superspreader events, so it comes back to the key messages during the first phase," he adds.
