These are names from an online edutainment series that's making waves on social media. A group of 9 and 10-year-olds are behind the unique township-based series which focuses on topics like women empowerment, relationships and gender-based violence. It's all the more significant as South Africa observes 16 Days of Activism. The cast of Amantombazane the Girls vs Abafana the Boys says it's overwhelmed by the support from South Africans. Director, writer and producer Sanele Skhakhane started out with just four kids and a desire to make a difference. “My aim was to develop kids, take them off the streets and give them something to do," said Skhakhane. "Not only for entertainment purposes but to also to educate them. So I decided to write something that they can relate to their lives and their future.” The group of Grade 4s say despite battling with equipment and other resources, they will continue producing series to help raise leaders of tomorrow. * eNCA's Mawande Kheswa reports.
