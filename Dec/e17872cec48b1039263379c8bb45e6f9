The C-19 People's Coalition wants to meet with health professionals to make sure the vaccine is distributed fairly and as early as possible. "We rely on pharmaceuticals to provide this supply and it simply not good enough, the UN and 140 countries at the world trade organisation in Geneva are pushing for equal access to the vaccine and this is critical," said Rehad Desai from the People's Coalition.

South Africa is in line to receive the Covax vaccine but there is still no clarity on when it will land in the country. On Monday President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that South Africa is set to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in the second quarter of 2021.
