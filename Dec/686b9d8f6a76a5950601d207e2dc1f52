Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG  - Community Development Practioner Victor Seshoka says higher education must be accessible to all, including the rural youth. Seshoka, who is the founder of the Kgalalelo Education Foundation, has been nominated alongside Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng and Health Minister Zweli Mkhize. Seshoka's foundation is helping rural youth access higher education. "I have realised through my journey that rural learners do not have access to the resource in making sure they get access to tertiary education. "Majority of them have a challenge in access resources such as application because of challenges of data." "With my team, we decide to go to rural areas in the country, so that they can have access to  education at the highest level."
