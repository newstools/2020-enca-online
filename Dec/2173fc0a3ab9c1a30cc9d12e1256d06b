If you've played the lotto before, you know the odds of winning are pretty small. Many might think you need a complex series of random numbers to win. But 20 lucky people in South Africa are now about R5.6-million richer after just keeping it simple. Head of Corporate Relations at Ithuba, Busisiwe Msizi, explains the winning combination is not that strange.

The consecutive numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and a "PowerBall" number of 10 were the National Lottery's winning combination on Tuesday night. READ: 20 people to share Powerball jackpot winnings Twenty lucky players hit the jackpot and won R5.6-million each. Another 79 won around 6,283 rand ($407) for guessing the sequence but missing the PowerBall. "Congratulations to tonight's 20 winners of PowerBall draw," the lottery tweeted late on Tuesday. "These numbers may be unexpected but we see many players opt to play these sequences." Many perplexed South Africans took to social media on Wednesday, alleging the results has been fixed. "Lotto exposing themselves that they are a scam," posted one Twitter user. "20 people discussed this and shared that jackpot equally," ventured another. "Absolutely no way in hell that's a coincidence." Some even called for a judicial graft probe. South Africa's National Lotteries Commission (NLC), which regulates the game, said the six consecutive number combination was unprecedented and vowed to look into the draw. NLC spokesman Ndivhuho Mafela said the commission will conduct a review "and if there is anything that went wrong we will declare that." "So we are in the process of doing that currently."
