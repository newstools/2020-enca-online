The High Court in Pretoria has overturned Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga's decision to order a rewrite after the papers were found to have been leaked before the exams. The court found the decision unlawful and irregular. Afriforum, Sadtu and others took the Basic Education Department to court to challenge the rewrite. READ: Matric exam rewrite decision declared unlawful Last week, Minister Angie Motshekga announced that the two papers would be re-written on 15-17 December. Sadtu general secretary, Mugwena Maluleke said the news is good for learners and said it would be irresponsible for the Department to challenge the ruling. Department spokesperson Elijah Mahlangu tweeted, "the Department of Basic Education is currently studying and processing the judgment internally. At the right time, soon, a statement will be issued with a response. No further comment for now."
