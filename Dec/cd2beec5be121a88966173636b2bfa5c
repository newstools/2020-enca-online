The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, dedicated to the magic of movies and set to host iconic Hollywood treasures from Judy Garland's "Wizard of Oz" ruby slippers to Dracula's cape, has been beset by delays. It had been set to finally open 30 April, the week after the Academy's flagship event -- the Oscars -- but will now welcome visitors from 30 September. President Bill Kramer said in a statement that the museum was "ready and eager to welcome visitors in the spring," but "with the current surge of COVID-19, it would be irresponsible to maintain an April opening." "We know a new day is coming for us all, and when it does, the Academy Museum will be ready to offer our visitors the remarkable experience we have all been wanting." The futuristic Academy museum contains a 1,000-seat theatre inside a seemingly-suspended glass, steel and concrete orb designed by Renzo Piano, connected by sky bridges to a converted department store housing the main galleries -- and the recently installed 25-foot shark model used in "Jaws." "Now it's just a matter of patience, for all of us, as we look ahead to opening our doors on September 30," said museum chair and Netflix content chief Ted Sarandos.
