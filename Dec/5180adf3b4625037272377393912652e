That's because Gumede has not yet received the court indictment. She was arrested in May 2019 for her alleged involvement in a corrupt R450-million Durban Solid Waste tender. Last year, she was fired as the mayor but in August this year she was sworn in as a member of the KwaZulu Natal Provincial Legislature.

Gumede is currently out on R50,000 bail and is expected back in court in March next year. The ANC has welcomed the Integrity Committee's decision. "The integrity commission unanimously resolved that there's no information before it which warrants a recommendation the ANC provincial executive committee for comrades Zandile, Zoe and Thembelihle to be either recalled or suspended from their deployment as eThekwini councilors and a member of the provincial legislature respectively; or even to step aside pending the finalization of the criminal proceedings,” said KZN ANC Secretary, Mdumiseni Ntuli.
