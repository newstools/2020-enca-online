JOHANNESBURG - Struggling Kaizer Chiefs will hope for better fortunes when they host the Angolan side, Primeiro de Agosto, in the Caf Champions League first round, first-leg clash on Wednesday evening. Amakhosi are two matches away from their maiden group stage appearance. It's been a nightmare start to the season for Chiefs, and they will be hoping to end the year on a high with a victory in the Caf Champions League. Chiefs defender Ramahlwe Mphahlele says they are expecting a difficult game. "We know they are a good team, we are aware of the danger they can cause but we are playing a home," "We are two games away to the Caf Champions' league group stages and then from there we are playing against the big boys and chances of getting to the quarterfinals are very high. We are taking it very serious and want to give it everything that we have since locally we are struggling a little bit so we want to do well in this competition," Mphahlele said.

The Soweto Giants last appeared in the Champions League four years ago. Meanwhile, Primeiro de Agosto are regulars in this competition with a lot of experience. They are expected to give The Glamour a torrid time as they are hoping to advance to the group stages.
