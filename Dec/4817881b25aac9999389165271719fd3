Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - A bail bid by the third police officer allegedly involved in Nathaniel Julies murder case has been postponed. Sergeant Vorster Netshiongolo filed his second bail application based on what he says are new facts. He is charged with defeating the ends of justice for allegedly concealing evidence. READ: Mourners pay tribute to Nathaniel Julies Julies (16) was shot in the head and chest, allegedly by officers outside his home in Eldorado Park earlier this year. The three officers were previously denied bail. Onke Maseti, Netshiongolo's defence lawyer, said there was a view that the officer would be able to interfere with witnesses given that he resides in the area but said should bail be granted, he would not be staying in the area. His wife, Nathinia Netshiongolo, said the process has been taking too long. "I also have children to raise. My kids are suffering through this whole process so I don't understand what is happening really. I don't understand this postponement."
