Under lockdown regulations, anyone caught without a mask in public will face a hefty fine or six months imprisonment or both. READ: Mask laws 'not an idle threat' "You have got to take it seriously that a mask is one of those things that will assist us in managing the spread and then, unfortunately, people who don't abide by these regulations then they will have to be dealt with," said Singabakho Nxumalo, spokesperson for the Correctional Services Department. "I think the Correctional Services is the last line in the justice system, we will have to really make space in terms of accomodating those people." Meanwhile, 8,462 prisoners and guards have tested positive for the virus, and 153 of them have died.
