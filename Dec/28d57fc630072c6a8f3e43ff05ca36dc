Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has announced the papers that were leaked will be rewritten. Maths paper two and physical science paper two will be rewritten on 15 and 17 December, respectively. READ: Leaked matric papers to be re-written The department says it was not an easy decision, but one that needed to be made to retain the credibility of the National Senior Certificate. One person who works for the printing company contracted to print the matric papers has been arrested in connection with at least one of the leaks. Education quality assurance body Umalusi says there needs to be better vetting of people who deal with examination papers. READ: One person arrested in connection with matric exam leaks Umalusi CEO Mafu Rakometsi said, "as far as the processes that the department is following in terms of the logistics and storage of the papers, the transportation of them, Umalusi is satisfied that everything is in place and intact. "What remains a problem is the human element. These are people who work with exam papers. "My sense is that not everybody has a full appreciation of how delicate the process is. What remains to be tightened is the human element," Rakometsi said. "There has to be vetting of people who work with examinations and the fact that they understand the transformation agenda of this country is critical for me."
