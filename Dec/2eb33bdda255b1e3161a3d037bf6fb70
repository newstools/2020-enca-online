The N1 highway is heavily backed up on Wednesday afternoon following a major accident. A truck lost control and crashed, resulting in a fire. Two fatalities and no other injuries have been reported by the City of Johannesburg emergency services. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said earlier: "The truck was transporting cars when the truck driver lost control and drove through the centre median. It is confirmed that people have been injured, the number of people have not been established, but at least three lanes, affecting in both North and South directions." The JMPD said long delays on the N1, in both northbound and southbound directions, are expected to continue into peak hour traffic. Road users are advised to avoid the N1 between Allandale and New Road and use alternative routes such as Old Pretoria Road or the R55.
