AFP/Emmanuel Dunand AMSTERDAM - Fishermen in the Dutch port of IJmuiden are bringing home the last catch of the year, but if Brexit talks fail it could be their last from British waters for years to come. As dock workers offload pallets of frozen fish from trawlers at the busy river mouth port just west of Amsterdam, a political storm is brewing that could sink their business. The highly-charged issue of fishing rights threatens to torpedo hopes of a trade deal when the UK leaves the EU single market on January 1.

While commercial fishing makes up a relatively small chunk of the economies of coastal nations like Britain, France and the Netherlands, it has outsize political importance. The fate of under-threat fishing communities like IJmuiden goes to the heart of ideas of national sovereignty and identity -- and of trade. READ: Britain braces for Brexit no-deal The Dutch fishing industry, including the processing and trade of fish, prawns and shellfish has a yearly turnover of around 4.5 billion euros ($5.5-billion). It provides jobs for as many as 7,000 people and is represented by some 216 companies in the Netherlands, according to figures by the Dutch umbrella fishing federation the Visfederatie. Britain is adamant that it will decide who gets to fish it in its waters after 1 January, but Brussels wants to secure a long-term agreement guaranteeing access for EU boats. EU negotiator Michel Barnier said there were "just a few hours" to overcome divisions with Britain, and confirmed fishing remains the slipperiest issue.
