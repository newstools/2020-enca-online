JOHANNESBURG - SAA Business Rescue Practitioners have given 383 pilots a lock-out notice until Friday. This means, from Friday at 12pm, those that are members of the South African Airways Pilots' Association will be excluded from the company premises until SAAPA accepts the demands made in the lock-out letter. The demands include that all pilots work under new terms and conditions of employment and that they will also have new salary scales. READ: DPE to pay outstanding salaries to SAA employees Business rescue practitioners say this is all part of a plan to restructure the nation's struggling carrier. Government had accused the pilots of greed and rejected many of their demands. DPE's Director-General Kgathatso Tlhakudi says pilots' salaries cannot be defended in their current form.
