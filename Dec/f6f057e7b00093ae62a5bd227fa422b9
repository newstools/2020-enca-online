Saul Loeb/Pool/AFP WASHINGTON - US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday urged Ethiopian Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed to end fighting, voicing concern as a military offensive pursued the Tigray region's dissident leaders. Pompeo in a phone call with Abiy "called for a complete end to the fighting and constructive dialogue to resolve the crisis," a State Department statement said.

Pompeo called for the protection of civilians from harm and "urged the government of Ethiopia to ensure respect for human rights of Tigrayans and all ethnic groups."

Ethiopia is a major US ally but concerns have grown after the fighting left thousands dead and sent tens of thousands of refugees fleeing into Sudan.
