The Basic Education department defended its decision to ask matriculants to rewrite the two leaked exam papers. Several organisations, including Afriforum, are against the decision, claiming that it's not justified but the Department is adamant the rewrites are necessary for protecting the integrity of the National Senior Certificate. One person has been arrested for links to the leaked papers. The Department has not yet filed a defending affidavit and the matter has been moved to Thursday. According to the Basic Education Department spokesperson, Elijah Mhlanga, the reason the department has not submitted the affidavit is that they have been dealing with multiple cases. "Every time when you want to finalise <a> case, you receive legal documents from another group or organisation," he says. "All of these are being dealt with by the same team." According to Mhlanga, the department was only aware of Sadtu's plan and not those of the other organisations.
