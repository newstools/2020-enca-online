Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - One person has been arrested in connection with matric exam leaks. "There is one arrest which has been made in Gauteng, which was linked to the physics paper. The Physics paper did not go far so we have not made the link with the Maths and Business Economics [papers] so that we would have linked them," Motshekga said. "The fact that we lost three papers shows that there was a hole in the system." READ: Another matric exam paper leaked Last month, Physics paper two was leaked just hours before matric pupils sat down to write it. A week earlier, Maths paper two was also leaked. The Hawks were brought in to investigate the leak of that paper.
