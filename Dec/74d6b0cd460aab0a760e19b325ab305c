They're refusing to pay rates because they've been breathing in the stench of sewage for two years. The City's blaming the big stink on a pump station problem. According to residents, they have been pleading with the City to fix the blocked drains since 2018. Adding to the filth are some residents from a nearby settlement.

Mama said over the years, his business has suffered because of the blocked drains. “I sell fish and chips and the business has been negatively impacted by the stench. You can smell it from afar and I’ve lost workers too,” he says.
