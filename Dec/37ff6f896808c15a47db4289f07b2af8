AFP/Tolga Akmen LONDON -Â British pop legend Paul McCartney urged people to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, as he celebrated the release of a new solo album crafted during this year's lockdown. The former Beatle, who revealed in October he had resurrected unfinished music to complete the record, said the internet had allowed so-called anti-vaxxers' misleading messages to "take hold". "I will (have the vaccine), and I'd like to encourage people to get it too," he told BBC radio. "There used to be anti-vaccine people, that was OK, that was their choice. "But with the internet now these things really take hold and so you do get these people who won't take it." The new album "McCartney III", released a week later than originally planned, is his third eponymous solo album. It follows months of work at his home studio in Sussex, in southern England, on previously started and new songs. It has all been written, produced and performed by McCartney, who has said he had not intended to release an album in 2020 until the pandemic forced him to stay at home for months. McCartney's new release coincides with the 50th anniversary of his first solo endeavour, "McCartney" , released as the "Fab Four" went their separate ways in 1970. A follow-up, "McCartney II", came a decade later. The latest collection of tracks was mostly built from live takes of McCartney on vocals and guitar or piano, before overdubbing with his bass playing and drumming.
