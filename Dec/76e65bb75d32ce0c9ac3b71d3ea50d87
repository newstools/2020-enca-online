Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - You may be scared of contracting COVID-19 now that we're in a second wave, but that's not a good enough reason to cancel your holiday. The National Consumer Commission says the Consumer Protection Act only allows for full refunds if a consumer dies or is hospitalised.

"They've urged suppliers and consumers to co-operate to move bookings around to a viable date, rather than go the route of a cancellation which obviously hurts the pockets of both parties." Holidaymakers can take matters like these up with Consumer Goods and Services Ombud.
