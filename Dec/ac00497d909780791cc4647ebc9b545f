Some of the beneficiaries of new homes have been waiting since 1996 to have a place to call their own. The new homes were handed over by the City of Johannesburg this week. The country's economic hub wants to clear the massive housing backlog it currently faces.
"We are sitting at 468,000 backlog in our housing, people that are registered staying in the City of Johannesburg," said Mlungisi Mabaso, Johannesburg Housing MMC. "We have introduced other programmes like the upgrade of informal settlements."
The Lufhereng Integrated Housing Development is one of the initiatives the City is using to ensure people get decent homes. * eNCA's Khayelihle Khumalo reports.
