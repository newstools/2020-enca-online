The 16 Days of Activism against gender-based violence is coming to an end. eNCA’s current affairs show Checkpoint will give viewers an update on the alleged serial sexual offenders they’ve revealed and tracked throughout the year. Checkpoint producer Harri Vithi first exposed a gym instructor in February this year and then in June spoke to victims of a former labour relations manager at Buffalo City College in the Eastern Cape. Both men had seemingly gotten away with a string of sexual crimes until Checkpoint started asking questions. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The 16 Days of Activism against gender-based violence is coming to an end. In June this year, Checkpoint exposed so-called labour relations manager Malesela Sebelebele who is accused of sexually harassing female staff members at Buffalo City College or BCC in East London. Sebelebele’s victims had two options -- give in or get out. Following Checkpoint’s broadcast, the higher education and training department launched an investigation. Sebelebele was dismissed on 5 October. Another alleged sexual abuser Checkpoint has been tracking is former gym instructor, Fanyana Khamandisa. He almost slipped through the cracks of the criminal justice system when he was granted bail on 12 October. That's because two detectives assigned to two cases involving Khamandisa showcased their incompetence on national television. After Checkpoint exposed police ineptitude in these cases, the SAPS was forced to act. The two detectives were removed from the specialised sexual offences division or FCS, pending an urgent departmental process. On 28 October Khamandisa was re-arrested for a rape case -- opened by Tswaki Matshidza in 2016 but ignored by police -- as well as the alleged sexual assault of Ntswaki Muhovha. With a new detective assigned to the cases, a defiant Khamandisa was denied bail and remains behind bars. * Make sure to tune into Checkpoint at 10pm for the full story.
