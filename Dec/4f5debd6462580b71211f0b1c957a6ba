AFP/CNS BEIJING - An unmanned Chinese spacecraft carrying rocks and soil from the Moon returned safely to Earth early on Thursday, completing another chapter in China's effort to become a space superpower. The mission was the first in four decades to collect lunar samples, emulating the feats of the United States and the Soviet Union from the 1960s and 1970s -- and going a few steps further. Scientists hope the samples will give insights into the Moon's origins and volcanic activity, though a more immediate focus was on how the mission showcased China's technological advances.

"This was very important to them -- and still risky, as the automatic rendezvous, docking and sample transfer in lunar orbit had never been done before, by anyone. It's a sign of the maturity of the Chinese space effort that it went off so flawlessly." In images broadcast on state television, the blackened capsule landed on snow-covered grasslands in darkness in the country's remote north.

Chang'e-5 -- named after a mythical Chinese Moon goddess -- landed on the Moon on 1 December. During two days on the Moon, it collected 2kg of material in a volcanic area called Mons Ruemker in the Oceanus Procellarum -- or "Ocean of Storms" -- which was previously unexplored, China's space agency said.
