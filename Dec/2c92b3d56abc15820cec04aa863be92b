AFP/Prakash Mathema NEPAL - The highest point on Earth got a bit higher on Tuesday as China and Nepal finally agreed on a precise elevation for Mount Everest after decades of debate. The agreed height unveiled at a joint news conference in Kathmandu of 8,848.86 metres was 86 centimetres higher than the measurement previously recognised by Nepal, and more than four metres above China's official figure.

Nepal decided to conduct the survey -- it's first -- after suggestions that tectonic plate movements including a major earthquake in 2015 may have affected the height.
