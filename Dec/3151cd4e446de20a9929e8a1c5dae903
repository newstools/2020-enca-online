Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Women in abusive relationships are often too scared to report cases to the police. Often they receive no help while their abusers get away with their crimes. But a new helpline promises to assist those who have been suffering in silence. The National Shelter Movement of South Africa says many victims have lost faith in the country’s criminal justice system.

"So, what we are aiming with the helpline is number one give women access to shelters immediately. "We will be assisting women once they approach the police to lay a criminal charge." Social workers from the movement are on hand to give women advice on their rights, as well as to help them acquire protection orders. READ: 16 Days of Activism: When will the violence end? The organisation says it has been inundated with calls from victims of gender-based violence since it launched its hotline on Tuesday. Women suffering at the hands of their partners can call 0800 001005. They will then be advised about how to seek help and break the cycle of abuse. * eNCA Ronald Masinda reports.
