Zimbabwe's remote Binga district is home to the BaTonga people. WATCH: New Zimbabwe border post It was set up in the late 1950's to re-house those whose homes were flooded when the country's Lake Kariba was built and filled but it's been marginalised since independence in1980 with few schools and fewer health centres. Residents say the area has so much natural beauty to offer local tourists and those from around the globe.
The Binga Residents Association's Moffat Mutale said, "we have got the sand beach but all what we need is to develop those areas so that people from outside can come and see." "The lake its self is man-made, people will be amazed to see such a big lake like this... we have hot-springs some are here at Binga centre some around the district. There is a lot of things we can talk about actually in Binga. We have got a lot these wild animals talk of buffalos, talk of elephants and animals like lions there are plenty here in Binga"
The wildlife here is said to be abundant.
Clayton Siachoke, a resident of Binga said, "we have the Croc farm where we keep crocodiles. It's a place which has potential, but actually, people have not yet discovered it. if people can come and visit Binga I think they will know more also understand the place of Binga."
Zimbabwe's Tourism Authority which promotes the country's tourist destinations recently promised that it's doing all it can to develop and market Bings to the world.
