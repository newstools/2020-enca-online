Corruption Watch executive director David Lewis spoke with eNCA's Devan Murugan on how SA companies performed according to their transparency. Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Private companies that are not listed on the JSE have been flagged in a new study by Corruption Watch and the National Business initiative. The companies, which are not governed by transparency regulation, have performed poorly in the latest anti-corruption rankings. The anti-corruption advocacy group says there is also a big gap in the scores of the best performing listed companies and the average score. OPINION: SA's draft procurement bill falls short In a study of 100 local companies, corporate South Africa produced a score of 59 percent. The average of the top five companies performing well on the transparency front is 85 percent. The report uses public information to rank companies on three major themes: anti-corruption programs and campaigns, organisational transparency.

Corruption Watch executive director David Lewis said corporate South Africa has not done well on reporting but they have good marks for transparency. "There's a lack of detail about, for example, what is the incidence of corruption in your company, which would be very helpful. We've found a bit of a tendency for companies to try and deal with actual incidents of corruption in a very private setting," Lewis said.
