Mercedes' British driver Lewis Hamilton celebrates on the podium after winning the Portuguese Formula One Grand Prix at the Autodromo Internacional do Algarve on October 25, 2020 in Portimao. SAKHIR, Bahrain - World champion Lewis Hamilton has tested positive for coronavirus and will miss this weekend's Sakhir Grand Prix in Bahrain, Formula One's governing body FIA announced Tuesday. "In accordance with COVID-19 protocols and public health authority guidelines in Bahrain he (Hamilton) is now isolating," said an FIA statement. "The procedures set out by the FIA and Formula 1 will ensure no wider impact on this weekend's event." Hamilton who on Sunday won the Bahrain Grand Prix, the first of back-to-back races in the Gulf state, has already secured a record-equalling seventh world championship this season. "He woke up on Monday morning with mild symptoms and was informed at the same time that a contact prior to arrival in Bahrain had subsequently tested positive," a statement from Hamilton's Mercedes team said. "Lewis therefore took a further test and returned a positive result. This has since been confirmed by a retest. "Lewis is now isolating in accordance with COVID-19 protocols and public health authority guidelines in Bahrain. "Apart from mild symptoms, he is otherwise fit and well, and the entire team sends him its very best wishes for a swift recovery." The team added that Hamilton had been tested three times last week and returned a negative result each time as part of the sport's strict anti-virus protocols, the last of which was on Sunday afternoon at the Bahrain circuit.
