AFP/Frazer Harrison MIAMI - US rapper Lil Wayne pleaded guilty Friday to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon over an incident dating back to last year, US media reported -- a federal offense that could see him sentenced to up to 10 years in prison. The 38-year-old artist, whose real name is Dwayne Michael Carter Jr, was found to be carrying a gun and bullets when police searched a private plane in Miami in December last year. "Your honor, I plead guilty," he reportedly told US District Judge Kathleen Williams during a virtual hearing. The Miami Herald said that Lil Wayne -- who has a home in south Florida -- admitted the gold-plated pistol found in his luggage was his. He told police the weapon had been given to him as a Father's Day gift.

The five-time Grammy winner -- who more recently made headlines for meeting with and voicing support for President Donald Trump -- will face sentencing on January 28.
