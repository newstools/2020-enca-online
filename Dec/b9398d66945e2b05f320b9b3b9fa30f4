Orlando Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer JOHANNESBURG - Orlando Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer begins on Tuesday, a CAF Confederation Cup campaign and hopesÂ  he will end with him becoming the first German to lift the trophy. Spanish and Swiss coaches have each won the African equivalent of the UEFA Europa League twice and French and Dutch coaches once, with Africans masterminding the other 11 triumphs. Pirates are away to Sagrada Esperanca of Angola in a last 32 first leg and Zinnbauer says he has footage of opponents "who will not be pushovers". Pirates are long overdue CAF glory, having won the African Cup of Champions Clubs (now CAF Champions League) in 1995 and the CAF Super Cup one year later. They came close twice since, losing to Al Ahly of Egypt in the 2013 Champions League final and to Etoile Sahel of Tunisia in the Confederation Cup final two seasons later. Zinnbauer can choose from a strong squad, skippered by national team centre-back Thulani Hlatshwayo and including Ghana goalkeeper Richard Ofori, Namibia winger Deon Hotto and Malawi forward Frank Mhango.
