The North Gauteng High Court has ruled that beaches must remain closed. This is the second ruling cementing government's decision to have some beaches shut down from 16 December until 3 January. Afriforum's legal team say they are dissappointed with the judgment. For more reaction, AfriForum's legal representative, Daniel Eloff spoke to Uveka Rangappa. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Afriforum will not appeal the High Court's dismissal of its bid to have beaches reopened. The lobby group wanted beaches in the Eastern Cape and Garden Route reopened, it also wanted KZN beaches to be open on all days.

"I think we also echo the same sentiments as John Steenhuisen, AfriForum is quite proud that we have maintained our record for fighting for South Africans civil rights during the lockdown period. However, AfriForum maintains that beaches do not contribute to the spread of COVID-19 and is still concerned about the economic impact.
