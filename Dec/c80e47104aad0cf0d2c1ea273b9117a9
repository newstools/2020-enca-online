Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - The effect of COVID-19 on schooling means many matrics are not finishing their final year. Pupils are finding concentrating in classes very difficult because several teachers and classmates have tested positive for COVID-19. The Sophumelela High School has seen 10 matrics drop out this year while the Beacon High School had 11 matrics drop out. The school says pupils are not getting the necessary emotional support at home. Matric exam paper leaks have made matters even worse. In the Western Cape, around 42,000 pupils have been affected by the leaking of maths and physical science paper two exams. The Western Cape Education Department says it will provide pupils with all the support needed to succeed in 2020, even if it means some will have to rewrite exams. * eNCA's Ronald Masinda reports.
