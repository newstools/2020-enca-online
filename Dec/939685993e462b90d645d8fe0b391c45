According to the latest available statistics, it is the only sub-district with more than 500 active COVID-19 cases.
For health workers the busy CBD is terrifying. READ: Nelson Mandela Bay Metro declared a COVID-19 hotspot "Guys don't understand how traumatising it is. Even in the passage to see a body wheeled past you," said Bridgette Veenendaal, a health worker. "It's so scary knowing that your kids are so small and that you can take the virus home with you."
It doesn't help that the area's water supply is often interrupted. READ: Eastern Cape govt welcomes new COVID-19 regulations Although the sale of alcohol is forbidden on weekends under new restrictions, it doesn't stop people from getting drinks to take home on a Sunday.
