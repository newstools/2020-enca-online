AfriForum, Sadtu and other organisations are challenging the decision to rewrite two Matric examinations in court. Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Afriforum says Basic Education Minister, Angie Motshekga doesn't care about pupils. The statement came in response to Motshekga's announcement that pupils would have to rewrite two leaked papers on the 15 and 17 December.

Pelser said the Department had other options to follow the leak trail. "They could've audited the distribution chain, can appoint a private investigating company to follow trail of the leak. This did not happen." Judge Norman Davis will hand down judgment on Friday.
