The EFF said Kieswetter's appointment was corrupt and nepotism was involved. READ:Â Parliament to wrap up EFF hearings Manuel has welcomed the court judgment. "It is very important that we return to who we are, and who we are should be defined by ubuntu, it is respect for other people, it means that we don't abuse other people and we don't slander them," Manuel said. "That is the gist of what emanates from the judgment handed down today, it is defamatory and therefore unlawful."
