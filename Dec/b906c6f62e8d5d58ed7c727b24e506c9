Glenn Maxwell survived two reviews, was caught off a no-ball and finished with three sixes before he was out for 54 off 36 balls. AFP/David Gray SYDNEY - Matthew Wade hit his highest T20 score and an eventful Glenn Maxwell half-century lifted Australia to 186 for five in the final match of the series against India in Sydney on Tuesday. A raucous crowd of over 28,000 - with attendance limits lifted in new Covid-19 protocols by the NSW government - were entertained by some madcap batting from Maxwell to post a competitive total. Maxwell had a night out. He survived two reviews, was caught off a no-ball, had a six prevented by athletic Sanju Samson fielding over the rope and finished with three sixes before he was out for 54 off 36 balls. Wade put on 90 with Maxwell for the third wicket before he was leg before wicket to Shardul Thakur for 80 - his highest T20 score - off 53 balls with seven fours and two sixes. Maxwell put on a typical 'Big Show' and chanced his luck as he unfurled his full repertoire of quirky shot-making. Skipper Aaron Finch, back in the side from injury, went the first ball he faced off slow bowler Washington Sundar, bunting it straight to Hardik Pandya at mid-off. Steve Smith had a life on 18 with KL Rahul's mis-stumping but was bowled three balls later on 22 when he was deceived by a slower Sundar delivery going for a big hit only to miss and see his off-bail dislodged. Wade had a big moment on 50 when Kohli, fielding deep, delayed calling for a review for leg before wicket off Natarajan but he was ruled late on the call and the review was disallowed. Replays showed Wade was out. Unchanged India are chasing a 3-0 series sweep in Australia for the second time in five years after losing the preceding one-day international series 2-1.
