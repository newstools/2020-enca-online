The Basic Education Department finds itself embroiled in controversy. #DStv403 #eNCA JOHANNESBURG - Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga is sticking to her decision, saying she can't see any room for compromise and the rewrite must go ahead. WATCH:Â Motshekga briefing on 2020 Matric exams The Basic Education Department finds itself embroiled in controversy. So far, three parties are heading to the courts to stop the rewrite of Mathematics Paper 2 and Physical Sciences Paper 2, after the exam papers were leaked. Motshekga said, "teachers, they say an organisation from Limpopo, so they were taking me through the arguments, they have cited all of us, Umalusi, all MEC's. We're going to court. I don't know what to comprise on. I don't know what will be the comprise because there are two things here. Either we write or don't rewrite." The minister says the rewrite is necessary because most provinces were affected. "There is nothing more important for a certificate than its integrity and its credibility. If it gets questioned and is under threat, I don't think there is any debate going there. If Umalusi, were saying they would not recognise results from those papers, then it closes the debate, I can't even put my personal views forward, because what is important is the impact on the children." Quality assurer Umalusi is backing the department. It has agreed that the credibility and integrity of the results are at stake if there is no rewrite.
