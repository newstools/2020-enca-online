The Koena Art Institute wants to showcase artworks by indigenous artists CAPE TOWN - A new gallery is helping celebrate and preserve indigenous art. The Koena Art institute in Observatory, Cape Town, has become the perfect place for Khoi and San artists from across the country to finally have a space to showcase their work. The Institute, which operates as a non-profit, has been selling art online since 2018. This is, however, the first time that the public can view the pieces in person.
