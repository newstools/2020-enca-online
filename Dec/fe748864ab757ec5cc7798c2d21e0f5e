The Committee on Foreign Investment had given TikTok parent ByteDance, based in China, until midnight to come up with an acceptable deal to put TikTok's American assets into US hands.

The US had already backed off enforcing a ban on TikTok, in compliance with a court order in favor of the Chinese-owned social media sensation. The White House claims TikTok is a national security risk because of potential links to the Chinese government through its parent firm ByteDance. TikTok has repeatedly defended itself against allegations of data transfers to the Chinese government. It says its servers where user information is stored are located in the United States and Singapore. A US federal judge in late October issued an injunction temporarily blocking an executive order by Trump aimed at banning TikTok, throwing up a legal roadblock. The judge's ruling hit the brakes on a Trump threat to knock TikTok offline by cutting it off from US businesses providing website hosting, data storage and other fundamentals needed to operate.

It was the second restraint issued in favor of TikTok by US judges against a set of executive orders issued by Trump which sought to ban new downloads of the app beginning in September, and ban it outright by mid-November. A temporary injunction issued in September in a separate suit filed by TikTok itself prevented the government from removing it from mobile application download platforms. Judges in both cases said in rulings that the chances of proving in court that Trump overstepped his authority were good. They also equated TikTok to films, photographs, and news wires with legal protections. The Friday deadline was for ByteDance to come up with a deal to sell TikTok operations in the US. "The committee is engaging with ByteDance to complete the divestment and other steps necessary to resolve the national security risks arising from the transaction, consistent with the president’s August 14 order," said a spokesperson for the Treasury, which oversees the committee. TikTok declined to comment. READ: TikTok to keep ticking in US for now A tentative deal has been unveiled that would make Silicon Valley giant Oracle the technology partner for TikTok and a stakeholder in a new entity to be known as TikTok Global. Oracle would manage data security through its cloud servers, while TikTok would retain control of its algorithms and technology, according to details of the proposed deal shared earlier this year. However, Trump has said he would not approve a deal with any Chinese ownership or control. China, meanwhile, has tightened  control of technology exports in a move that promised to complicate any deal for TikTok to sell US assets.
