CAPE TOWN - The National Sea Rescue Institute is pleading for extra caution in the water this festive season. The Institute is concerned about people swimming in lakes, dams and pools, as some beaches remain closed. READ: NSRI urges public to be vigilant of high tides NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon said; "and obviously at the moment the concern is because the beaches are closed on certain days or some that are closed until after the new year. We're asking for everyone to have a safety conscience mindset. And in particular for children to have responsible adult supervision overseeing children while they're in the water swimming..." "The priority is to have somebody dedicated not distracted by their phone conversation to physically watch. Drowning is a silent affair it happens quickly so somebody has to physically while they're in the water."
