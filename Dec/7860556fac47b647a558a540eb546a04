Hospitals there are under severe pressure, with 98 healthcare workers currently ill with the virus. George, which has the most cases outside Cape Town, has closed its public areas and cancelled sports events as a safety measure. Tourism in the region has suffered enormous economic losses and the sector's urging holidaymakers not to cancel their plans.
