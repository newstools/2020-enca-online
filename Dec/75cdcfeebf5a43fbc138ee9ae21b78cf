Gavin Hunt has struggled since succeeding sacked German Ernst Middendorp during the close season with just three wins and six goals from 10 matches in domestic and African competitions. BackpagePix/Gerhard Duraan JOHANNESBURG - Perennial CAF Champions League underachievers Kaizer Chiefs won a 2021 preliminary round tie at the weekend, but coach Gavin Hunt was furious at the way they eliminated Cameroonians PWD Bamenda. Chiefs wasted numerous scoring chances in Soweto and could only draw 0-0 with opponents who arrived in South Africa only on the morning of the match after visa complications. "I have seen nothing like that in 30 years as a coach," said Hunt, referring to woeful finishing after Chiefs qualified 1-0 on aggregate thanks to a late first-leg goal from defender Eric Mathoho. Hunt has struggled since succeeding sacked German Ernst Middendorp during the close season with just three wins and six goals from 10 matches in domestic and African competitions. The absence of injured leading scorer Samir Nurkovic from Serbia has not helped, nor has FIFA imposing a transfer ban until mid-2021 because Chiefs illegally bought a player from a club in Madagascar. Critics of Hunt say he still has the squad that was good enough to lead the South African Premiership for 28 of 30 rounds last season before faltering on the final day and finishing runners-up.
