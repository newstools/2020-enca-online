Judge Norman Davis said the decision to rewrite was irregular, unlawful, must be reviewed and set aside. The government arguedÂ matriculants will lose the entire academic year if the rewrites of two leaked papers don't go ahead. Afriforum, Sadtu and others took the Department to court, following the announcement that Maths Paper 2 and Physical Science paper 2 will be rewritten next week.
