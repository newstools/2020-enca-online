NAC's Integrity Commission report advises Magashule vacate his office immediately. JOHANNESBURG - A leaked report recommending ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule step aside, is not urgent enough to warrant a special NEC meeting. That's according to the governing ANC. Its Integrity Commission report advises Magashule vacate his office immediately and is scathing in its criticism of the ANC NEC. The Integrity Commission says the ANC NEC is scared to act against Ace Magashule, and avoids implementing its resolutions.

"We will actually call on members of the ANC, and everyone else that occupies a position of responsibility in the organization, to desist from leaking information that might otherwise sponsor divisions in the organization," said ANC spokesperson, Pule Mabe. Despite the report calling for Magashule's immediate suspension if he refuses to step aside, the ANC says there's no rush to convene a special NEC meeting to discuss it.
