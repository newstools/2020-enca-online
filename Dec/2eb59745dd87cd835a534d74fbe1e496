Sandile Zungu (Chairman of AmaZulu) with Benni McCarthy, coach of AmaZulu and Manzini Zungu during the DStv Premiership 2020/21 AmaZulu Coach Announcement at the Zungu on Main, Johannesburg on the 13 December 2020. DURBAN - Former Cape Town City FC head coach Benni McCarthy has another opportunity to prove his coaching credentials.
McCarthy has taken over as AmaZulu FCÂ head coach. The club's ambitious new management unveiled him, as the replacement for club favourite Ayanda Dlamini. READ: Dlamini steps down as AmaZulu head coach McCarthy will have the tough task of meeting the club's ambitions, among which is challenging for a top four spot in the league. Usuthu have only won one of their opening six Premiership matches. That form was a major reason why Dlamini was relieved of his duties. So it goes without saying that McCarthy needs to hit the ground running.
