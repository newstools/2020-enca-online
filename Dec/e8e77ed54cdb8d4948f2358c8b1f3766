Courtesy #DStv403  CAPE TOWN - Fog harvesting is a way of conserving water and avoiding droughts. And now, Cape Town's water and waste committee has installed two fog nets near Table Mountain. In 2018, Cape Town declared a Day Zero. The city was gripped by a crippling drought due to insufficient rainfall. 
Fast forward to 18 months ago when the city's water and waste committee installed fog nests. This in a bid to come up with better ways to save water. 
"In response to that drought, the city invested in implementing desalination water reuse and aqua for abstraction at an accelerated rate," said Xanthea Limberg. "But we're also looking at innovative ways for our water supply." Weather experts believe this initiative could yield positive results. It's proven to be a success in countries like Ecuador, Chile, Pero and Oman. 
"These projects should be scalable in order for a significant amount of water to be harvested from the fog nest," said eNCA meteorologist Anika de Beer. "That is exactly why Table Mountain is such an interesting site to experiment with fog nests, because Table Mountain has 184 days with per annum with fog."* eNCA's Nobesuthu Hejana reports.
