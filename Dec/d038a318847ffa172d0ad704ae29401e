The ANC's integrity commission will finally confront ANC Secretary-General, Ace Magashule but, his appearance may be futile, as the commission can only make recommendations to the NEC. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - ANC Secretary-General, Ace Magashule is expected to face the party's Integrity Commission on Saturday. Magashule will attempt to clear his name on corruption charges. Some analysts say those expecting sparks this weekend will be disappointed. A group of ANC veterans in the Free State, say the party's national executive committee has failed to deal with Magashule. "Is the integrity committee going to discuss the issue of resolution with him? The resolution is a conference resolution, which was endorsed by the 30 August meeting of the NEC. And the decision has to be enforced," said Ike Moroe, Magashule's former advisor. "So for me, it's quite strange what the integrity committee is going to discuss with him, that it has not discussed with him before." READ: Magashule to appear before the integrity commission but what next? Political analysts say we shouldn't expect fireworks from the Integrity Commission. They say it's a toothless structure. "From the onset, he knows and perhaps knew prior to the decision made that the integrity committee is a toothless job, it doesn't bite. And there's overwhelming evidence to that effect that the element of inconsistency has for some time now characterised the way in which it conducts its business," said political analyst, Barry Hanyane. The integrity Committee is a structure made up of ANC veterans. Should they recommend that Magashule step-aside, the NEC may have to enforce their proposal but it's unlikely Magashule will go down without a fight. e.tv News reporter, Pule Letshwiti-Jones has more details on the story in the video above.
