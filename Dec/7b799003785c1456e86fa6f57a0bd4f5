Places of accommodation will remain open, but many attractions have been red-taped. "The beaches are closed in the Western Cape, in the Eastern Cape and KZN. They are closed for everything, expect for fisherman. Northern Cape is the only place where people can go to the beach", said Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.

The regulations will be in place until 15 January and South Africans will have to accept them.
