Samples of surface dust and pristine material collected from the asteroid Ryugu by the Hayabusa-2 space probe. AFP/JAXA TOKYO - Scientists in Japan said they were left "speechless" when they saw how much asteroid dust was inside a capsule delivered by the Hayabusa-2 space probe in an unprecedented mission. The Japanese probe collected surface dust and pristine material last year from the asteroid Ryugu, around 300 million kilometres away, during two daring phases of its six-year mission. This month it dropped off a capsule containing the samples, which created a fireball as it entered the Earth's atmosphere, and landed in the Australian desert before being transported to Japan. Scientists at the Japanese space agency JAXA on Tuesday removed the screws to the capsule's inner container, having already found a small amount of asteroid dust in the outer shell. "When we actually opened it, I was speechless. It was more than we expected and there was so much that I was truly impressed," said JAXA scientist Hirotaka Sawada.

Scientists hope the material will shed light on the formation of the universe and perhaps offer clues about how life began on Earth. The scientists have not yet revealed if the material inside is equal to, or perhaps even more, than the 0.1 grams they had said they hoped to discover. Seiichiro Watanabe, a Hayabusa project scientist and professor at Nagoya University, said he was nonetheless thrilled. "There are a lot (of samples) and it seems they contain plenty of organic matter," he said. "So I hope we can find out many things about how organic substances have developed on the parent body of Ryugu."
