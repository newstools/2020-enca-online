Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - The Public Works Department is a self-declared mess and is running the risk of another border scandal. Minister Patricia de Lille says the jersey barrier between KwaZulu-Natal and Mozambique looks set to become a failed project. Her department has updated Parliament on corrective measures taken to fix the Beitbridge border fence, which has caused months of outrage and national embarrassment.

"It’s because more than 12 of the senior managers have been appointed irregularly without the necessary qualifications.” Thirteen officials are facing a final warning over their handling of this substandard Beitbridge border fence, which has cost the taxpayer R37-million.

While the Special Investigating Unit is trying to claw back the money on the failed Beitbridge fence, De Lille says new border projects need to be tackled differently. “I’ve gone as far as to ask the department to go out for a request for information so we can test the market, so we can see what type of technologies are available in the market so that when we make a presentation to the DOD we can present different options.” Parliament says it will be keeping a close watch on the department in the new year because it’s evident it’s not functioning optimally. * eNCA's Lindsay Dentlinger reports.
