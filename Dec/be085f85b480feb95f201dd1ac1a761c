AFP/Daniel Leal-Olivas LONDON - London is to move into the highest level of coronavirus restrictions due to concern about spiralling numbers of infections, the health minister said. The British capital's move into "Tier 3" from Wednesday means theatres, as well as pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues, will have to close, except for takeaway food.

"This action is absolutely essential, not just to keep people safe but because we have seen early action can prevent more damage and longer-term problems later," he told parliament. In some areas, cases are doubling every seven days, he said, warning: "It only takes a few doublings for the NHS (National Health Service) to be overwhelmed."

But he said: "There's currently nothing to suggest it is more likely to cause serious cases and the latest clinical advice is it is highly unlikely to fail to respond to a vaccine." Currently London is in "Tier 2", which means non-essential shops and services can open, but it currently has one of the highest infection rates in the country. London Mayor Sadiq Khan called the rise in cases "deeply concerning" but warned Prime Minister Boris Johnson the move would be "catastrophic" for pubs, bars and arts venues.
