With two time US motocross champion Ken Roczen as his role model, it's no surprise that Trenton Kretzmann is already South Africa's 50cc motocross champ at just eight years old. eNCA's Siphokazi Malinga caught up with him. Courtesy #DStv403  DURBAN - Trenton Kretzmann's parents have always been big on motorbikes. They got their son hooked at the age of two, and since then the young Kretzmann has never looked back. The eight-year-old took part in a ten race series at three tracks across the country. His seven victories saw him crowned South African champion. When the country went into lockdown, it meant several months with no racing. Trenton is grateful that his parents and brother are his biggest cheerleaders. He hopes to defend his title next year in the 50cc category. * eNCA's Siphokazi Malinga has more details on the video above.
