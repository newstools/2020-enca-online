Orlando Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer begins on Tuesday, a CAF Confederation Cup campaign and hopes he will end with him becoming the first German to lift the trophy. JOHANNESBURG - Orlando Pirates switch their attention to Caf duties when they visit Angolan side Sagrada Esperança in Luanda on Tuesday afternoon. The Buccaneers, who recently won the MTN8 and are still unbeaten in the Premiership, will hope to replicate their domestic form into the Confederation Cup. Coach Josef Zinnbauer hopes his charges will remain focused during their first leg preliminary clash. “I‘m happy we can go to CAF now, yes it’s Christmas time but we do not have gifts for the opponents, we have to fight for points," Zinnbauer said.
