On Tuesday, former Eskom board chairperson Ben Ngubane gave evidence. He defended the appointment of Brian Molefe as Eskom CEO, saying Molefe is one of few highly skilled black executives. But he conceded it was wrong that Gupta associate, Salim Essa, was told of Molefe's appointment a year before it became official.
