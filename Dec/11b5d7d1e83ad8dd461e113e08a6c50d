Lions and Sharks players vie for the ball during the Carling Currie Cup match in Johannesburg. BackpagePix/Lefty Shivambu/Gallo Images JOHANNESBURG - A brilliant break by Wandisile Simelane set up Tiaan Swanepoel for a victory-sealing try as the Lions defeated the Sharks 27-12 in the South African Currie Cup. The outcome of the fourth round match at Ellis Park in Johannesburg hung in the balance with eight minutes remaining and the Lions ahead by eight points. After the hosts gained possession off a scrum, a ruck developed in midfield before some slick passing sent centre Simelane clear and he dodged numerous tackles before sending full-back Swanepoel clear. Captain and fly-half Elton Jantjies converted and there was no way back for the Sharks, who began the match second on the table but dropped to third after the loss as the Lions leapfrogged them. The Bulls have 35 points, Lions 29, Sharks 28, Western Province 26, defending champions Cheetahs 21, Pumas 12 and Griquas seven with the top four finishers securing semi-finals places. All Currie Cup matches are played behind closed doors because of the coronavirus.
