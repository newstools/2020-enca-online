Eskom and the Special Investigating Unit is briefing the media today about corruption within the power utility. It's expected to make an important announcement. Ministers Pravin Gordhan and Ronald Lamola will also form part of the briefing. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom and the Special Investigating Unit will recover R1.56 billion in overpayments made to ABB South Africa. The SIU and the power utility made a joint announcement on Friday afternoon. The NPA and SIU are investigating the alleged corruption at Eskom. SIU head Andy Mothibi said the investigating unit cooperated with the Hawks and FBI for the investigations which began in 2018. It was found that ABB South Africa was awarded a contract by Eskom to do work at Khusile power station. The contract was awarded through corrupt means. SIU and Eskom agreed on review to set aside the ABB contract. Mothibi said, "we are delighted at this settlement, which is an important vindication of the tireless efforts of the SIU investigators working in close cooperation with the Eskom and ABB teams." ABB will pay the R1.56 billion within 14 days of signing an agreement. The recovered money will be used to reduce Eskom's debts and debt service costs.
