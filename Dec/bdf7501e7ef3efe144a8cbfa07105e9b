READ: All countries must get COVID-19 vaccine: Ramaphosa "The only viable defence against COVID-19 is the vaccine, there are now many initiatives around the world to speed up the development of the vaccine," said Ramaphosa. "We continue to collaborate with partners in the international community to ensure all countries have access to an effective and affordable vaccine so that no one is left behind." Ramaphosa says South Africa is participating in the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 Global Vaccine Access Facility – known as the Covax facility.
