The Western Cape government has been discussing implementing localised restrictions in a bid to stifle a resurgence in some areas. The Garden Route has already stopped any planned public events in the region. As infections continue to rise in the province, families are reconsidering their options for the holidays. READ: Health Minister concerned by rising cases in Eastern, Western Cape Some have simply decided not to take a chance by cancelling trips to other provinces. “We weren’t gonna expose ourselves to the second wave of the COVID-19," said Rochelle Koeberg. "I’m extremely worried about it for my children because they are used to going to the beach, going to restaurants, having fun during December. I don’t know what I’m gonna do with them if we’re not able to do that.” Some holiday resorts are noticing a drop in bookings, a far cry from the jam-packed season they usually experience this time of the year.

SA Tourism and the Federated Hospitality Association of South Africa say they’re hopeful government leaders will find a balance between protecting lives and livelihoods, as the sector may not be able to recover from another hard lockdown. * eNCA's Monique Mortlock reports.
