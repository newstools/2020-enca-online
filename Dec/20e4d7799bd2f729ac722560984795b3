The DA’s John Steenhuisen. JOHANNESBURG - DA leader John Steenhuisen says Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment policy is not working. Steenhuisen says black households are poorer and unemployment has increased since the policy was introduced. READ: DA says government's BEE redress policies not working "No matter how noble BBBEE might have been and the intention might have been, we have to accept that it has been a failure and black households are now 10-perfect poorer than they were at the commencement of it and unemployment has jumped up dramatically," he said. "In fact, we have many more people living in poverty now than ever before. It is very clear that those policies and the very narrow focus has not worked."
