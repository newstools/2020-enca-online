It is challenging some of the proposed amendments, particularly those related to adoptions.

The Bill has been tabled in Parliament and members of the public had until last Friday to make submissions. READ: KZN father wants his adopted children back Sector head of the Solidarity Occupational Guild for Social Workers, Marisa Engelbrecht, said, "it's going to be catastrophic, children are the next generation. "If we're going to tell we're not going to be able to place them with a happy family because of a system that is not working, then we're gonna have a serious problem." The Children's Act may soon be amended, and this could lead to a decline in adoptions, say critics. Courtesy #DStv403 #MorningNewsToday #eNCAOnline
