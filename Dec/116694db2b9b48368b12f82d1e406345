Australia's paceman Josh Hazlewood shouts during the cricket Test match between Australia and India. AFP/William West ADELAIDE -Â Australia's world-class pace attack dismissed India for their lowest ever Test score of 36 on Saturday, with the hosts needing 75 to win the opening Test in Adelaide at dinner after an incredible batting collapse. India started day three of the day-night Test on nine for one and with a 62-run lead, looking to build a competitive second innings total for Australia to chase. But their hopes were left in tatters after an exhibition of fast bowling by Josh Hazlewood (5-8) and Pat Cummins (4-21). India's previous Test low was 42 against England at Lord's in 1974. Their 36 was the joint fourth lowest of all time with New Zealand's 26 against England in 1955 at Auckland the worst ever. Their capitulation left Australia needing 90 to win, with Joe Burns and Matthew Wade knocking off 15 of them before the dinner break. A four from Hanuma Vihari at least took India past New Zealand's all-time low to spare them that embarrassment.
