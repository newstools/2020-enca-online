WINDHOEK - Namibia's government said the country would reopen to foreign visitors from 1 September to try and salvage thousands of jobs in tourism badly hit by coronavirus travel bans. The announcement came despite a recent spike in coronavirus cases, which have almost tripled to over 6,000 this month. Recorded deaths have risen from 11 to 57 since August 1. "As from 1 September 2020, Namibia re-opens the Hosea Kutako International Airport to international tourists," Environment Minister Pohamba Shifeta announced on Tuesday.
