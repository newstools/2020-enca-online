The ANC is announcing the outcomes of an investigation into three senior members including, Johannesburg Mayor, Geoff Makhubo.

Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The ANC’s Gauteng Integrity Committee has claimed its first scalps. The integrity committee has recommended the firing of two mayors for sleeping on the job while officials unlawfully invested tens of millions of rands into the now-defunct VBS bank. The party leadership has endorsed the recommendation, together with another relating to Johannesburg mayor, Geoff Makhubo, who has been let off the hook. Once cleared by their comrades in a previous internal investigation, it’s second time unlucky for Merafong City Local Municipality mayor, Maphefo Mogale-Letsie, and her former West Rand District counterpart and now MP, Boyce Maneli. The West Rand invested R81-million into the now-defunct VBS bank, while Merafong invested R50-million.

He was accused of improperly pocketing millions through a company he had shares in, while he was also the political head of the city’s finance and treasury division. This was at a time when the ANC ran the Joburg municipality under then-mayor Parks Tau. “The integrity committee received complaints of impropriety and conflict of interest, after extensive interviews and examining the evidence, the PIC cleared comrade Geoff of any conflict of interest,” said ANC Gauteng Secretary Jacob Khawe. The integrity committee now shifts its focus to the case involving presidential spokesperson and party provincial executive member Khusela Diko, Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku and his wife and Joburg councillor, Loyiso Masuku.
Their hearing begins on Monday.
