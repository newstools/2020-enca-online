Courtesy #DStv403 GABORONE - The case involving a Botswana state security agent accused of espionage and financing political unrest in Botswana has been postponed again. Other highly politically connected South Africans -- including businesswoman Bridgette Motsepe-Radebe -- were also allegedly involved. The Botswana government says it's struggling to get information to build its case in the alleged fraud, espionage and money laundering scandal. READ: Botswana appoints AfriForum in case involving Motsepe-Radebe Investigation editor from the Botswana Guardian, Dikarabo Ramadubu, said the prosecution said they want to charge or add more persons. But did not mention who those persons are. AfriForum is representing the Botswana government and says the South African government is not cooperating. Advocate Gerrie Nel said the response from the Department of Justice is "absolutely horrific". WATCH: Motsepe-Radebe hits back over Botswana bank scandal "We’ve written them a letter on the 20th of July, it’s quite a strong letter, we even say, failure of the refusal is tantamount to defeating the ends of justice. There’s been absolutely no response from the Department of Justice whatsoever .” The Justice and Correctional Services says it cannot reply to AfriForum’s request. It says it can only respond through diplomatic processes with the Botswana government.
