A US Secret Service uniform officer's bike is seen laying on the sidewalk on Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House in Washington, DC after a shooting incident. WASHINGTON - US Secret Service agents shot and wounded a man who was apparently armed outside the White House on Monday, President Donald Trump said. A 51-year-old male approached a Secret Service officer standing at the corner of 17th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, one block from the White House, according to Tom Sullivan, the chief of the Secret Service Uniformed Division. The suspect told the officer he had a weapon and ran "aggressively" towards him, drawing an object out of his clothes, Sullivan said in a statement that was broadcast on Twitter.

As the president was speaking to reporters in the White House briefing room, a Secret Service bodyguard abruptly approached him and interrupted, saying in a quiet voice, "Sir, could you please come with me?" Trump and staff members left. Doors to the briefing room, still filled with journalists, were locked.

"Law enforcement shot someone, it seems to be the suspect. And the suspect is on the way to the hospital," he said. Trump went on to praise the US Secret Service, which is in charge of guarding the president, as "fantastic people, the best of the best." "I feel very safe with Secret Service," he said. "A lot of terrific-looking people ready to go if something was necessary."
