Death penalty protesters outside of John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse during the official sentencing of Boston Marathon Bomber Dzhokar Tsarnaev. BOSTON - The US Justice Department said it will ask the nation's top court to reinstate the Boston Marathon bomber's death sentence for helping carry out the 2013 attack that killed three people and wounded more than 260 others. US Attorney Andrew Lelling in Boston said that after considering victims' views, the department had decided to ask the US Supreme Court to review an appellate court's July 31 decision to order a new death penalty phase trial for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. "Our hope is that this will result in reinstatement of the original sentence and avoid a retrial of the death penalty phase," Lelling said in a statement. READ: Boston bomber's lawyers seek new trial Victims have been divided over seeking the death penalty, and David Patton, Tsarnaev's lawyer, had argued prosecutors should allow "closure" by permitting a life prison sentence. In its ruling, the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that a trial judge "fell short" in conducting the jury selection process and screening jurors for potential bias following pretrial publicity. Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, sparked five days of panic in Boston on 15 April 2013, when they detonated two homemade pressure-cooker bombs at the marathon's finish line and then tried to flee the city. READ: Boston Marathon bomber apologises, sentenced to death In the days that followed, they also killed a police officer. Tsarnaev's brother died after a gunfight with police. A federal jury in 2015 found Tsarnaev guilty of all 30 counts he faced and later determined he deserved execution for a bomb he planted that killed 8-year-old Martin Richard and 23-year-old Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu. Restaurant manager Krystle Campbell was also killed.
