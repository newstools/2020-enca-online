LAKE CHARLES - At least six people were killed by Hurricane Laura in Louisiana and search teams may find more victims, but the governor said that the most powerful storm to make landfall in the US state in living memory did not cause the "catastrophic" damage that had been feared. "We have a lot to be thankful for," Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said at a press conference. "It is clear that we did not sustain and suffer the absolute catastrophic damage that we thought was likely based on the forecast we had last night," Edwards said.

Hurricane Laura struck the coast of Louisiana early Thursday as a Category 4 storm -- the second-highest on the wind scale. It has since been downgraded to a tropical storm. The Louisiana health department reported there had been six storm-related deaths. According to Edwards, four of them were "related to trees falling on residences."

"I'm concerned that as we continue to go out and do primary and secondary search and rescue, we're going to find more fatalities," Edwards said. "I hope not and pray not." Satellite images revealed the immense size of the hurricane as it made landfall as a Category 4 storm overnight near the town of Cameron, close to the border with Texas, packing sustained winds of 240km/h.
