According to a survey by PayCurve, almost 80-percent of South Africans look for expensive unsecured loans to help them meet their monthly financial obligations. The finding highlight South Africans' deteriorating finances in an economy that was already in a recession, with a third of the labour force unemployed, before the first COVID-19 case was confirmed. The survey shows many have been forced to work more than one job. If unable to find the extra work, they take loans to buy food, pay school fees, and cover emergency expenses.
