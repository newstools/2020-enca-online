NEW YORK - New York's Museum of Modern Art reopened its doors following a nearly six-month shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, allowing visitors the rare experience of viewing its works by Monet, Van Gogh and Warhol without the usual throngs of visitors. MOMA is the first major museum in the Big Apple to reopen to the public since the US cultural capital was hard-hit by the virus, bringing its busy calendar to a halt. Under the new regulations, and with the tourism sector at a standstill due to the pandemic, only a few art lovers reserved a time slot for the church-like calm of reopening day.

"I like galleries not being too crowded and people not talking and people not taking pictures. Everything about it is great," Alan Orenbuch, a 66-year-old retiree and museum regular, told AFP. "In recent years, it just attracted people who had it on their bucket list when visiting New York, it wasn't the same thing," he said.

"It's really a very special time to visit the galleries, because the galleries aren't as crowded, but also, it's such a wonderful opportunity for visitors to gather safely... in a difficult time," she said. The grand reopening was meticulously planned, and it's "just so gratifying to see the plans in action and the doors open and visitors back," Shrier added.
