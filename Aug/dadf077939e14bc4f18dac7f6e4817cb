Courtesy #DStv403  JOHANNESBURG - NSFAS has halted funding to 5,000 students for this year after SARS alerted the scheme that the students come from homes with an income of more than the R350,000 threshold. The students have two weeks to petition the decision. "Affected students have 14 days to petition this decision by submitting proof of family income or change of income to NSFAS for review," NSFAS administrator Randall Carolissen said. He urged students to use the two-week period to make their cases.

"At this time when there is uncertainty in the sector, when there is uncertainty about the academic year. "Some students are preparing for their semester exams now, some are awaiting second-semester registration."
