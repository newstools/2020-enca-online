The trust, which was established by the Matsila Royal Family of Limpopo, wants to reintroduce the bank to the market as a commercial bank. "The idea to revive the bank came out of a need that we see after the collapse of VBS bank left a huge gap in terms of financial assistance to grow the economy and create jobs at the local level," said Chief Livhuwani Matsila.

Meanwhile, market analyst, Nesan Nair, says reviving the bank might not be a bad idea. "It's going to be difficult but there are always opportunities and I think the focus should be on how you exploit opportunity in the face of what's a lot of competition," he said.
