Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - It seems like nothing can make South Africans panic quite like the whispers of another alcohol ban doing the rounds. A voice note which has been circulating, indicating liquor stores are closing Tuesday, has sent tipplers flocking to liquor outlets to stock up. Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs spokesperson Lungi Mtshali says an investigation has been launched to track the source of the voice note. "The fake news is not only compromising people's lives but it is also setting us back in the fight against COVID-19," Msthali said. Mtshali says the matter has been escalated to the police.
