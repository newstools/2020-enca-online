LOS ANGELES - The Kia Classic, scheduled from 24 to 27 September in Carlsbad, California, has been cancelled, the LPGA said. "We appreciate all of the efforts by Kia to try and make this event happen this year, and we look forward to playing again at beautiful Aviara Golf Club in 2021," LPGA Commissioner Mike Whan said in a statement. The tournament, won last year by Japan's Nasa Hataoka, was originally scheduled for March, but pushed to September as the LPGA calendar was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.
