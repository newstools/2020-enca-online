"I was shot while I was running away, so much so that they fired the final bullets as I lay on the ground," Magidiwana said.

It’s no secret, even the doctors know that [the police] were making sure they were killing me.” In a series of emails between him and the Lonmin board, Ramaphosa had called for concomitant action to end some of the violence during the protests in the lead-up to the massacre. Magidwana now says government must understand that Ramaphosa's actions facilitated the killings. He says if the president were to appear in court, everyone would know the law is supreme whether you are rich or poor. eNCA approached the Presidency for comment. * eNCA reporter Aviwe Mtila filed this report.
