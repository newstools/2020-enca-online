File: AB de Villiers quit international cricket in 2018 but plays in Twenty20 leagues in South Africa and Australia. NEW DELHI - South African stalwarts AB de Villiers and Dale Steyn still have plenty to offer at this year's Indian Premier League (IPL) despite their recent lack of involvement in top-level cricket, Royal Challengers Bangalore team director Mike Hesson has said. De Villiers (36) quit international cricket in 2018 but plays in Twenty20 leagues in South Africa and Australia. He was on the winning team in an experimental three-team tournament in July.

So that certainly showed the quality of player he is," Hesson told a virtual media conference from Dubai on Wednesday. "He's had very, very good franchise tournaments around the world the last 12 months and he's in good touch.

And once again, he's one of the few in the group that are absolutely chomping at the bit to get into training." Fast bowler Steyn, who quit tests in 2019 to prolong his limited overs career, has played three Twenty20 International matches this year in addition to his stint in the Pakistan Super League.

This year's IPL will be played in the United Arab Emirates from 19 September.
