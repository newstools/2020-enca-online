JOHANNESBURG - The ANC delivered the outcomes of its much-talked-about ANC National Executive Committee meeting. The African National Congress went into the meeting on the back of a scathing letter from former President Jacob Zuma - blasting his successor Cyril Ramaphosa. ANC leaders will also have to deal with growing allegations of corruption linked to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) contracts - which have prompted calls for the party to pay more than just lip service to the looting.
