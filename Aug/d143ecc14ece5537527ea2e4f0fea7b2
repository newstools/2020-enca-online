Eskom says the move from stage two load-shedding to stage one is a result of supply constraints easing. Four generation units at Duvha, Kriel, Tutuka and Kusile have now fully returned to service. WATCH: Joburg battles electricity outages The power utility says three other generation units are expected to return to service during the course of Thursday night. Despite constraints easing, Eskom has again urged the public to use electricity sparingly as aged generation infrastructure is unreliable and volatile.  #PowerAlert 1
