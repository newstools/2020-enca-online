Morikawa, who was 65th in the rankings at the end of 2019, shot up seven places to world number five after his win, is eager to relish the spotlight and anything but complacent after the biggest win of his career. "When I woke up (on Sunday), I was like, this is meant to be. This is where I feel very comfortable. This is where I want to be, and I'm not scared from it," said Morikawa. "I think if I was scared from it, the last few holes would have been a little different, but you want to be in this position. "It doesn't stop here. I've got a very good taste of what this is like, what a major championship is like."
