The real suspect in the Mthwalume murders, who allegedly committed suicide at the weekend, shares his surname. Siphamandla Khomo shares a surname with the prime suspect in the Mthwalume murders case, in which the bodies of five women were found in a sugar cane field. Mduduzi Khomo, who was nabbed on Friday, was a petrol attendant.

Mduduzi Khomo, meanwhile, allegedly committed suicide while in police custody at the weekend. Khomo's worried about his reputation and safety, particularly at a time when emotions are running high over the deaths of the five women since April. He says he tried to open a case, but he was advised to seek legal assistance instead.
