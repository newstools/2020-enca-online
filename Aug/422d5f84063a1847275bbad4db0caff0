Serena Williams serves to Maria Sakkari during the Western & Southern Open. NEW YORK - Serena Williams was sent spinning out of the Western and Southern Open by Maria Sakkari after the Greek rallied from a set down to beat the 23-times Grand Slam champion 5-7 7-6(5) 6-1 and reach the quarter-finals. Williams raced to a 5-2 in the opening set before Sakkari drew level but the American raised her game again to take the early advantage in the rain-delayed contest. Williams trailed 3-1 in the second set before reeling off four games in a row and was serving for the match when things began to fall apart. World number 21 Sakkari dragged the set to a tie-breaker before levelling the contest at 1-1, then surged to a 5-0 lead in the decider and completed the upset win on her eighth match point with a powerful forehand. Sakkari said she did not play well but was delighted with the victory over the third seed. "I knew it was going to be an ugly match from my side but I'm extremely happy with the result," Sakkari said. "She's a role model for me and many others. What she has achieved in our sport is unique and I don't know if anyone else is going to do it again." Sakkari next faces Briton Johanna Konta, who got past Vera Zvonareva 6-4 6-2.
