Pope Francis is expected to resume limited public weekly audiences in September. VATICAN CITY - Pope Francis will resume limited public weekly audiences early next month, the Vatican announced, six months after the head of the Catholic Church halted the practice because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Wednesday events will be held in a closed courtyard of the Vatican's Apostolic Palace, where a maximum of 500 seats will be placed, rather than in St Peter's Square, a Vatican spokesman told AFP. Entry into the courtyard will open without reservation two hours before the audience, which will start at 9.30am, the Vatican official said. Jorge Bergoglio - the birth name of Francis -- last hosted an audience on February 26, as the grip of the COVID-19 disease closed around Italy.

At the time, few were wearing face masks for protection. Shortly afterwards, the pope cut back his schedule because of a "cold", raising questions about his health. So far, the coronavirus has killed more than 35,000 people in Italy since it was first detected, according to the latest official statistics.
