Mbalula joined her in a media briefing to share his condolences with the families of the deceased and, he's clear, he thinks drivers should not be allowed to consume any alcohol. "COVID or no COVID alcohol and drunk and driving is part of South Africa’s problem," Mbalula said. "When COVID arrived we were in the process of implementing the Aarto Bill that the president has signed into an act, I was also in parliament to amend the regulations ,to ensure that now you are now going to be arrested in South Africa if you are found drinking alcohol."
