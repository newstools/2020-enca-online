Eight years after the Marikana massacre, the tables appear to have turned. The National Union of Mineworkers is gaining more members at the former Lonmin mine, which now belongs to Sibanye.

JOHANNESBURG - Eight years after the Marikana massacre, the tables appear to have turned. The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) is gaining more members at the former Lonmin mine, which now belongs to Sibanye. The labour dispute between the NUM, rival union Amcu and Lonmin management resulted in the deaths of 34 mineworkers at the hands of police in 2012. READ: Marikana massacre: Survivor wants to see Ramaphosa in court When Lonmin mineworkers turned their backs on the NUM in 2011 they looked towards rival union Amcu and its president Joseph Mathunjwa to resolve their wage dispute with the platinum giant. In the days before the massacre, Mathunjwa met with Lonmin management and police and tried to avoid the bloodshed. These efforts were handsomely rewarded as Amcu experienced unprecedented growth and appeared to deal a death knell to the NUM on the Platinum Belt.

This has led to the NUM regaining some ground, and last year the union held its first rally in Marikana in seven years. It appears the NUM intends to maintain this advance while Amcu faces a rebellion from within.
