It's reported that former Cabinet Minister Malusi Gigaba had in May opened a case after he was tipped-off that an alleged hit on his life was in the pipeline. READ: Ex-cabinet minister's wife arrested On Friday, his wife was dramatically arrested and held in a Pretoria jail cell. She's been charged with assault and malicious damage to property. Responding to eNCA's inquiries about why the priority investigations unit, and not the police, got involved in the case, Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi said there was more to the story than what's been reported. He would not elaborate. The Hawks say a secondary investigation is underway into the wife of former minister Malusi Gigaba.

"It is not something very light, it is a very serious matter that we are dealing with. Unfortunately, we cannot get into those details. This is just one part of the investigations that we are dealing with," he said. READ: Why the Hawks made the Noma Gigaba arrest Norma Gigaba has been released on bail. Her attorney, Victor Nkwashu, confirmed her release on Saturday night. She is expected to appear in the Hatfield Magistrate court for a bail application on Monday.
