Members of the National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union are going ahead with their lunch-time pickets. Nehawu is striking over government’s refusal to increase public servants’ salaries and a failure to offer adequate personal protective equipment against the coronavirus. The union, which represents around 200,000 healthcare workers, is threatening to go on a full-blown strike next week.
