Restrictions have been eased, to allow for more movement and more sectors of the economy to reopen. SUMMARY: What's permitted and prohibited under level 2 lockdown Psychologist Mark Tomlinson says now that regulations are more relaxed, people should be even more cautious. "We know from other countries around the world that there is a third surge, a third peak - its very likely it is going to happen here. Hospitals are not as full as they were. Infections are going down. People are going to without question become complacent. Now is exactly the time when you don't want to become complacent."
