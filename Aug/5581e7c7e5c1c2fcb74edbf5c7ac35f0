Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The standoff between evicted Fleurhof residents and the Red Ants in Roodepoort, west of Johannesburg, continues. Dozens of residents were evicted two weeks ago for illegally occupying a government housing project. This after the property developer obtained a court order. READ: Evictions prohibited but may be granted by court Some residents say they have been occupying the property for about three to four years. "These people who are taking us out now during the lockdown, where are we going to go because we are not renting," said one Fleurhof resident. "We occupied these houses not illegally, we occupied them because we have been here for far too long without anyone being allocated."
