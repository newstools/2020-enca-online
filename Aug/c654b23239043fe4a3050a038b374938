"Zoom" is the sixth born at the park in Puebla to a herd of elephants rescued eight years ago in Namibia where they were threatened by poachers. PUEBLA - A baby African elephant whose birth was live-streamed by a safari park in Mexico has been named Zoom after the video chat app made popular by the coronavirus pandemic. The calf is the sixth born at the park in Puebla, southeast of the capital, to a herd of elephants rescued eight years ago in Namibia, where they were threatened by poachers.

"It's very useful for science, measuring times, fluid volumes, among other factors," he told AFP. The park said its goal is for the elephants to eventually return to Africa.

"People working in tourism were left without jobs due to the pandemic and they're looking for alternatives. The outlook is terrible."
