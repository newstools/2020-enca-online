Noa Toledo is an Israeli social-media star who hopes to encourage other women to rise to the challenge of male-dominated jobs. TEL AVIV - Twirling to hip hop over chasms of steel and glass, soapy squeegee in one hand and a smartphone in the other, Noa Toledo is an Israeli social media star who aims to encourage other women to take on her traditionally male-dominated job. The 22-year-old window washer's high-rise dance routines have earned close to 60,000 followers and more than a million "likes" on the TikTok platform. "When people see me behind the window, they're surprised. They see a woman, it's unusual," Toledo, a former champion pole-vaulter, told Reuters. "I don't know a lot of women doing this job, but I hope when they see me they understand that women can do it too." Revital Friedman, who lives in a beachfront apartment block, smiled and waved in recognition as Toledo rappelled into view in a harness and helmet. "She is divine," Friedman said. "She is the only one to ask if I'm happy, if it's really clean."
