JOHANNESBURG - South Africa's mining output fell 28.2% year-on-year in June, StatSA said Thursday, edging up only slightly as the coronavirus pandemic continues to hamper economic activity. In May, production was down 29.8-percent from 12 months earlier. Major drops were in the platinum group metals as well as iron ore and coal, according to StatsSA. Mineral sales also decreased by 14.2-percent year-on-year in June with the biggest drops in gold, followed by coal, other non-metallic minerals and platinum group metals. "The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown regulations since 27 March 2020 have had an extensive impact on economic activity," StatsSA said.

Mines are also one of the largest employers, with nearly half a million workers.
