An authentic master of ninjutsu martial art, Kazuki Ukita, poses at the Ninja museum in Japan. TOKYO - They came in the dead of night; no one saw them and nobody knew they were there. Moments later, the Japanese ninja museum was missing a safe full of cash. Under cover of darkness, thieves vanished with the 150kg strongbox containing around $9,500, paid as admission fees to the Iga-ryu Ninja Museum in central Japan. The museum is dedicated to the legend of the ninja -- the covert martial arts masters and agents of sabotage who prowled the shadows in feudal times, and were famous for secrecy and stealth.

The safe, which was stolen in the early hours of Monday, contained takings from around 1,100 weekend visitors, the Asahi Shimbun daily reported. The museum, in Iga, features a traditional ninja house and offers interactive experiences, allowing visitors to learn about ninja skills, throw star-shaped weapons, and watch ninja shows. The city's Mie University set up the world's first research centre devoted to ninja in 2017, and opened a graduate course a year later.
