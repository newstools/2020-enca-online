The State Capture Inquiry has heard evidence that Bosasa allegedly threw a birthday bash for former president Jacob Zuma, and gave then-minister Nomvula Mokonyane meat for Christmas. Bongiwe Dube testified about her experiences while working at Bosasa's head office. She was responsible for providing catering services. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Did former Minister Nomvula Mokonyane lie to the State Capture Inquiry? A paper trail appears to show how Bosasa allegedly paid for a swanky booze-filled birthday function in 2003. Mokonyane was the Gauteng MEC for Safety and Liaison at that time but, she claims any talk of sponsored birthday parties is pure fiction. READ: Bosasa asset seizure declared unlawful Frederick Hendrick Coetzee - the owner of the establishment that allegedly hosted Mokonyane’s birthday bash on 28 June, the date which matches her publicly recorded birthday - says Mokonyane had her 40th in 2003 which was arranged by Agrizzi. There’s a paper trail for the event totalling about R41,000. Bosasa also sponsored the booze. Agrizzi has confirmed to eNCA that he misspoke when he testified that Bosasa funded Mokonyane's 50th birthday, and that it was in fact, her 40th.
