File: The World Health Assembly is expected to focus almost solely on COVID-19. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday the event would be "one of the most important (WHAs) since we were founded in 1948". GENEVA - The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday that his agency was setting up a review committee to evaluate the performance of its International Health Regulations (IHR) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made the announcement to Geneva diplomats hours ahead of a press conference.

He said the review committee's first meeting would be on September 8-9. Gro Harlem Brundtland, one of Tedros' predecessors at the helm of the U.N. agency, told reporters in June that the WHO should change the IHR guidelines that led it to oppose travel restrictions early in the outbreak - a step criticised later by the United States.
