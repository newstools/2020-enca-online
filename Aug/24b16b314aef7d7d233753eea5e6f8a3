Keep your candles out and start charging all your gadgets. Eskom is implementing load-shedding again from 9 this morning. It says due to old generating infrastructure, the power cuts might continue for the rest of the week. Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha spoke to eNCA. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Eskom announced that Stage 2 load-shedding will continue on Wednesday from 9am to 10pm. Eskom said the breakdown of four units overnight and on Tuesday morning at Medupi, Duvha, Majuba and Lethabo power stations, as well as a delay in the expected return to service of a unit at Medupi, has resulted in the power system being constrained. LOAD-SHEDDING: Schedules, info, and how it affects you Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha said the company could not realistically promise an end to load-shedding this week and said it is possible that power cuts will continue next week as well. The power utility urges customers to reduce electricity usage to ease the strain on the system. #POWERALERT 2
