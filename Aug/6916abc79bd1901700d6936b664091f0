JOHANNESBURG - Children were said to be at lower risk of contracting COVID-19, but new research is suggesting otherwise. A new study has found that children under the age of five are major carriers of the virus.

Researchers believe that COVID-19 infected children may carry ten to a hundred times more genetic material for the virus in their nose, compared to adults. Researchers in Chicago tested swab samples from 145 individuals ages one month to 65 years with mild to moderate COVID-19. However, the researchers said on Thursday in JAMA Pediatrics, studies suggest that in young children, levels of the non-infectious genetic material may be linked with levels of active virus, and so these youngsters "can potentially be important drivers of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the general population." This comes as the debate over whether schools should remain closed rages globally.  - Additional reporting Reuters -
