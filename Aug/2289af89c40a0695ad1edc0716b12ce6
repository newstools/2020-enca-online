Iran's President Hassan Rouhani had expressed regret following Romina's killing and called for the speedy passing of several anti-violence bills. The girl had reportedly run away after her father refused to give permission for her to marry a man 15 years her senior. But she was detained by authorities and taken home, despite having pleaded with a judge that she feared for her life if returned. The man she wanted to marry, Bahman Khavari, was sentenced to two years in prison, local media said, without specifying the charge. The legal age of marriage for women in Iran is 13.
