Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Cricket South Africa has the tough task of mending broken race relations in the local game. CSA Director of Cricket Graeme Smith has vowed to continue listening to the lived experiences of former and current players. The former Proteas captain hopes this will be another step in transforming cricket into a more inclusive sport. Past and present players have recently spoken out about their racist encounters while playing cricket. Many have said even after speaking out, they were not heard or sometimes felt not safe to share their experiences with those in power.

"As far as I was aware, there were always channels, in management, in CEO, in President's positions. But obviously players didn't feel that way, that is an awareness thing, and something that we got to look back on and hopefully improve on going forward," Smith said. "The ability to listen to the players now and understand the challenges that they faced. I think that's the key as well. "Hopefully everyone involved in sharing their stories has no agenda's and wants to be part of the solutions, create a better environment going forward." READ: CSA to decide stance on Black Lives Matter movement There is still uncertainty around when the Proteas will return to action. Something that is of concern to cricket's mother body as there are no funds being generated with the inactivity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The players no doubt are rearing to go, and will hope they get their voices heard without prejudice or bias.
