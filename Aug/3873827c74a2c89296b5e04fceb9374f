SAN FRANCISCO - TikTok said it has removed more than 380,000 videos in the US this year as part of a part of a mission to "eliminate hate" on the platform. TikTok also banned some 1,300 accounts for breaking rules against hateful content or behavior, and deleted 64,000 comments on similar grounds, according to the video-snippet sharing sensation. "These numbers don't reflect a 100 percent success rate in catching every piece of hateful content or behavior, but they do indicate our commitment to action," TikTok US head of safety Eric Han said in a blog post. "Our goal is to eliminate hate on TikTok."
