SEOUL - South Korea ordered all schools and kindergartens in the greater Seoul region -- home to half the country's 52 million population -- to switch to online classes as they battle multiple coronavirus clusters. The country's "trace, test and treat" approach to curbing the virus has been held up as a global model, but it is now trying to contain several outbreaks, mostly linked to Protestant churches. South Korea reported 280 new infections on Tuesday, taking the country's total to 17,945.

"The alarming emergence of mass infections since August is turning up as infections of our students and staff members," education minister Yoo Eun-hae told reporters. Nearly 200 students and school staff had been infected with the virus in the past two weeks, she said. The only exception is for senior students in their final year of high school, who are due to take crucial university entrance exams in early December.
