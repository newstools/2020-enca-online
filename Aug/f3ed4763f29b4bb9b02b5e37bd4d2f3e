 While Africa has so far been spared high concentrations of COVID-19 cases in communities, we are starting to see a shift. Infections on the continent are set to surpass the one-million mark in the next 48-hours. JOHANNESBURG - Coronavirus has now infected more than one million people in Africa, but hopes that the pandemic may be peaking in some countries are mingled with fears of a second wave. Nations across the continent have recorded 1,011,495 infections and at least 22,115 deaths, accounting for around five percent of global cases, according to an AFP tally as at 1100 GMT Friday. Just five countries account for 75 percent of all cases, says the continent's health watchdog the Africa Centres for Diseases Control.

"African countries are doing their best, despite... limitations," such as weak health systems, Mary Stephen of the WHO Africa office, told AFP Friday. She, however, warned against the public complacency that can develop in prolonged outbreaks.

"We need to avoid complacency," she said in a phone interview from Brazzaville. Countries with high infections relative to the size of their populations include South Africa, Djibouti, Gabon, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe. East African nations Rwanda and Uganda have managed to significantly slow down transmission, while Mauritius has flattened the curve.
