For five months, commuters from Heathfield, Athlone, Maitland and Huisendal have had to find alternative transport due to the lockdown. Metrorail says after consulting widely and checking all necessary hygiene measures, it's decided to reopen the Cape Flats line train services. “It has to coincide with the opening of the school, we were listening to a lot of social media requests from the community of the Western Cape, they sincerely requested this line and we are introducing it today, and we are hopeful that in the next two weeks we will introduce the Cape Town to Kraaifontein line," said Prasa Regional Manager Raymond Maseko.

Prasa isn't planning on reopening that service just yet. "We then did an assessment of the infrastructure that had been vandalized, and that’s when we decided to have this staggered plan of return. It’s not that we’re not fully responsive to the needs of the commuters, of central or commuters of north. It just shows the shear work that needs to be done in the different corridors," Maseko said.

Metrorail says, while two of its corridors have been reopened, the commuter rail agency has no plans to make its services available at the weekend, at least for now.
