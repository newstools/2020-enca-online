Meghan Markle called for a "change" in the upcoming US presidential election. WASHINGTON - Meghan Markle, the wife of Prince Harry, broke from protocol normally followed by British royals in calling for a "change" in the upcoming US presidential election. Her comments came during a virtual "voter registration couch party" organised by When We All Vote, an outreach group co-chaired by former first lady Michelle Obama, actor Tom Hanks and others to increase participation at the polls.

"You're just as mobilised and energised to the change that we all need and deserve." "We vote to honour those who came before us and to protect those who will come after us - because that's what community is all about and that's specifically what this election is all about," she said. The "Suits" actress did not mention President Donald Trump, who will face Democrat Joe Biden at the polls on 3 November.
