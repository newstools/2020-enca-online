New Zealand Rugby said 14 Auckland-based players and five support staff were barred from leaving because of coronavirus restrictions. WELLINGTON - New Zealand's much-anticipated North v South Island rugby match was delayed after health authorities refused to let players travel from locked-down Auckland. Squads were due to assemble in Wellington on Monday ahead of the fixture, but New Zealand Rugby said 14 Auckland-based players and five support staff were barred from leaving because of coronavirus restrictions. As a result, New Zealand Rugby postponed the match for a week to 5 September.

The government is set to make a decision Monday on whether to continue the lockdown and New Zealand Rugby said it would wait until then to determine the match venue. The North-South match was first contested in 1897 and was once among the most anticipated and bitterly contested matches in the New Zealand rugby calendar.
