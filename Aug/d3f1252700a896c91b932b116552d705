As we observe women's month we talk to People Opposing Women Abuse about the link between alcohol and gender-based violence. Is there a link between the two? Mary Makgaba from POWA answers this question. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - As calls get louder for the alcohol ban to be lifted, People Opposing Women Abuse says the ban should remain. Mary Makgaba from POWA says alcohol consumption is partly to be blamed for the scourge of gender-based violence in the country. READ: Gender-based violence getting worse: activists "There is some evidence that heavy drinking or frequent drinking, particularly by males who are mostly perpetrators, increases the risk of violence," said Makgaba. Makgaba says the organisation does not support the lifting of the alcohol. Meanwhile, Cosatu has joined calls for the ban to be lifted. Cosatu says government has an equal duty to protect those who depend on the sale of alcohol to make a living. The union federation says strict regulations should be implemented, to ensure responsible drinking. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
