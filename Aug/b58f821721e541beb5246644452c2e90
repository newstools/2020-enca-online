Vusimusi Mngomezulu of Polokwane City tackled by Daniel Cardoso of Kaizer Chiefs during the Absa Premiership 2019/20 match. PRETORIA - Kaizer Chiefs stormed back to score three goals in five minutes and defeat Polokwane City 3-2 in Pretoria on Saturday, which stretched their South African Premiership lead to six points. Relegation-threatened Polokwane looked set to remain a bogey side for Chiefs when goals by Lesiba Nku and captain Jabu Maluleke gave them a two-goal advantage on 61 minutes. But the league leaders staged a stunning recovery and goals from Zimbabwean Willard Katsande, Kenyan Anthony Akumu and Serb Samir Nurkovic earned them three points. Strong-finishing Chiefs squandered a chance to increase their lead in stoppage time when Daniel Cardoso slammed a penalty against the crossbar with goalkeeper Cyril Chibwe beaten. The thrilling triumph lifted Chiefs to 52 points, six more than defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns, who have played one match less.

Chiefs' dramatic comeback in Pretoria atoned for dull Premiership fare elsewhere with three other matches producing just one goal and minimal excitement. The lone goal came from Ashley du Preez in Pretoria and enabled Stellenbosch to edge higher-placed Golden Arrows 1-0 and all but ensure their safety. A brilliant Ricardo Goss save from Mhango helped Bidvest Wits force a 0-0 draw in Johannesburg against third-place Pirates, who trail Chiefs by 10 points.
