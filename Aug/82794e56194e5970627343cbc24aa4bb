Lufa Farms on Wednesday inaugurated the facility that spans 15,000 square metres. MONTREAL - Building on a new hanging garden trend, a greenhouse atop a Montreal warehouse growing eggplants and tomatoes to meet demand for locally sourced foods has set a record as the largest in the world. It's not an obvious choice of location to cultivate organic vegetables -- in the heart of Canada's second-largest city -- but Lufa Farms on Wednesday inaugurated the facility that spans 15,000 square metres, or about the size of three football fields. "The company's mission is to grow food where people live and in a sustainable way," spokesman Thibault Sorret told AFP, as he showed off its first harvest of giant eggplants.

The first, built in 2011 at a cost of more than Can$2-million, broke new ground. At Lufa, about 100 varieties of vegetables and herbs are grown year-round in hydroponic containers lined with coconut coir and fed liquid nutrients, including lettuce, cucumbers, zucchini, bok choy, celery and sprouts. Bumblebees pollinate the plants, while wasps and ladybugs keep aphids in check, without the need for pesticides. Enough vegetables are harvested each week to feed 20,000 families, with baskets tailored for each at a base price of Can$30.

On the ground floor of the new greenhouse, a huge distribution centre brings together nearly 2,000 grocery products for offer to "Lufavores," including restaurants. Fully automated, the new greenhouse also has a water system that collects and reuses rainwater, resulting in savings of "up to 90 percent" compared to a traditional farm.
