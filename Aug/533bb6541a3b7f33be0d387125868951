Courtesy #DStv403 PIETERMARITZBURG - KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala on Friday said the province's officials are taking swift action against those implicated in misconduct. A 67-year-old man died after being treated in a makeshift "fever ward" in the Northdale hospital's parking lot. The managers who were responsible for allowing the treatment of patients in the outdoor space have been suspended.

That's where they [patients] were getting tested as they arrived and then be taken inside the hospital," Zikalala said. The KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu has also reassigned the hospital's acting CEO to her original position as a maternal health specialist. The premier said not all the officials in KwaZulu-Natal should be viewed in a negative light as the department has taken swift action. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
