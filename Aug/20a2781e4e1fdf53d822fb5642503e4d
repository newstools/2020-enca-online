Glen and Vida Rafferty were gunned down in Normandien on Saturday evening. KZN police spokesperson Nqobile Gwala says suspects ransacked the house before making off with their vehicle, which has since been recovered. WATCH: Bikers unite to end farm murders Family spokesperson and Chairman of the Normandien Farmers Association, Roland Collyer, says this tragedy leaves a massive void. “He was a cattle farmer in our area. Was our farm association chairman for many years before I’d taken over from him," Collyer said. "The farm labourers are here by us on the scene at the moment. These people are wanting to know where their next meal is coming from. "They’ve lost their supplier. The guy who’s supposed to be supplying them with work is now not there anymore.”
