File: Then-president Jacob Zuma and then-minister Derek Hanekom. JOHANNESBURG - Former president Jacob Zuma has publicly apologised to ANC veteran, Derek Hanekom. The apology is for a Tweet last year saying that Hanekom was a known enemy agent. Hanekom lodged a R500,000 defamation lawsuit against the former president. READ:Â Zuma in court for pre-trial hearing Zuma lost his Constitutional Court bid to appeal a judgment ordering him to apologise and pay damages for the Tweet. On Sunday afternoon he posted an apology on Twitter, in isiZulu and Hanekom has accepted the apology.  Apology accepted. As far as I am concerned, the matter is now closed, apart from the determination of costs and damages, and we can move on. https://t.co/FKaTciiKJu
