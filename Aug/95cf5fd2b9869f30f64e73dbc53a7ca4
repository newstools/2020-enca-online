This is according to the research by the Institute for Security Studies. #eNCA spoke to ISS Researcher, Richard Chelin. JOHANNESBURG - The Institute for Security Studies says it's too early to tell if the government is winning the war against the illicit cigarette trade.

"Now, during the lockdown, the illicit trade has increased. The ban has increased the capacity to address that issue." "Are they winning? Yes, they are making arrests. They are confiscating. They are doing the right things. They are making progress, but to say they are winning the fight is still to be seen."
