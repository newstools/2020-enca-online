OTTAWA - A pair of pandas on loan from China to a Canadian zoo are facing a food shortage as their supply of fresh bamboo dries up, officials warned. Plans to send them back to China, where bamboo is abundant and easy to access, according to a Calgary Zoo statement, have been stalled by pandemic-era changes to import and quarantine regulations. Er Shun, a female, and Da Mao, a male, each require around 40 kilograms of fresh bamboo daily. Calgary Zoo turned to farms in British Columbia for a temporary domestic supply after international borders were closed in a bid to limit the spread of COVID-19.

The zoo has been unable to secure travel permits from China, and last week expressed "increasing concerns for the giant pandas' well-being." "To date, China has not been able to approve international permits due to changes in its import laws and quarantine facilities due to COVID-19," zoo president Clement Lanthier said in a statement. "The continued delays in international permitting is putting the health and welfare of these two beautiful giant pandas in jeopardy."
