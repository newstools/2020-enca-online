ZURICH - Switzerland has plunged into recession after the coronavirus pandemic caused a "historic" 8.2% slump in economic activity in the second quarter, official figures showed Thursday. "In the second quarter, Switzerland's GDP (gross domestic product) suffered the biggest decline since records of quarterly data began in 1980," the economic affairs ministry (SECO) said in a statement. During the first quarter, the wealthy Alpine nation's economy shrank 2.5 % compared to the previous quarter, it said, revising the figure slightly from the 2.6% announced in June.

SECO pointed out that Switzerland was by no way unique, with the global economy also in sharp recession as the pandemic rages worldwide. To date, more than 820,000 people have died out of the some 24 million infected globally by the novel coronavirus. SECO stressed that in Switzerland, which has seen over 1,700 deaths and more than 40,000 cases, the "GDP decline remained limited in an international comparison."
