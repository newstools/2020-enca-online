Finance Minister Tito Mboweni tweeted about a chicken dish that he prepared. JOHANNESBURG - Finance Minister Tito Mboweni has South Africans talking again on Twitter. But don't worry, it's nothing work-related. Mboweni tweeted about a chicken dish that he prepared. Done. Mission accomplished. Simple but very tasty. And economic. pic.twitter.com/KSatg9r8CW As is the norm with South Africans, the responses were quite hilarious. Some were shocked at Mboweni's dinner and while some questioned his copious use of garlic, others argued it wasn't even cooking. Good luck with your next dish, minister -- they jury's still out on your cooking skills. Shuuuu! People who cook with water🚩🚩🚩🚩🤧 pic.twitter.com/qZwpp0Q9Kt Ok. Shout-out to Tito. This actually looks good when he done cooking pic.twitter.com/uf0RO0eL58 I'm still seeing garlic cloves in the pot pic.twitter.com/Dz8PsaDF3f The chunky tomatoes are probably for texture, right? Another job well-done, Minister👌🏽😋
