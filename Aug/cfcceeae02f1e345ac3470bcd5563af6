That's after the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal reversed its decision to appoint her to the province's legislature. READ: Zandile Gumede sworn in as KZN MPL The provincial executive committee met with Gumede on Friday, following a public outcry after the party decided to deploy Gumede to the legislature, despite facing fraud and corruption charges. Provincial Secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli gives the details on decision. The ANC says this is in line with the ANC's Nasrec resolution on dealing with corruption. Part of that resolution says the ANC should publicly disassociate itself from anyone, whether business donor, supporter or member, accused of corruption or reported to be involved in corruption.
