Barcelona's Uruguayan forward Luis Suarez (R) challenges Bayern Munich's German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer during the UEFA Champions League quarter-final football match. LISBON - Bayern Munich produced the mother of all Champions League thrashings against a helpless Barcelona by winning 8-2 in Friday's quarter-final in one of the most remarkable matches in the competition's history. Thomas Mueller gave a sign of what was to come by scoring in the fourth minute and although Barca quickly replied with a comical own goal from David Alaba and then missed two clear chances to take the lead, Bayern soon proved irresistible. Ivan Perisic, Serge Gnabry and another goal from Mueller in the space of 10 minutes put the Germans 4-1 up by halftime and not even Luis Suarez's strike after the interval gave Barca any sense that they stood a chance of getting back into the game.

Bayern, who last won Europe's biggest prize in 2013, will meet either Manchester City or Olympique Lyonnais in the last four. "We feel devastated, although shame is the real word I'm looking for," said Barca defender Gerard Pique, adding that the historic defeat called for urgent changes across the club.

Mueller added: "We had so much fun today. Of course, Barcelona are special, so we had to be even more aggressive and come back again and again. "You can imagine we feel good after this match but we have to be quiet and regenerate."
