Courtesy#DStv403 CAPE TOWN - At least 18 protesters have been arrested for public violence and malicious damage to property during an End Femicide protest in Cape Town. Hundreds of students and members of civil society organisations marched to Parliament on Saturday. They want the government to allocate more funds to prevent gender-based violence, as well as better services provided to survivors. READ: Gender-based violence getting worse: activists “It is unfair that the women of South Africa have to put themselves in more danger by coming to a protest," says Anti-GBV Movement Stellenbosch University Jesse Brand. Some protesters are calling on men to take a stand and protect women. “This is a men’s fight, women shouldn’t be fighting this fight. It’s our problem we are the problem. We have to fix the problem. It starts with me teaching my friend, my brother, my father, that’s the only way we can solve this problem” Organisers are waiting to see if their protest has the desired effect. Since June, at least four women have been murdered by intimate partners or men they knew in the Western Cape.
