In March, South African airports were shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic as hard lockdown regulations were enforced. As lockdown laws were eased, several airports were then reopened as limited domestic air travel for business travel was permitted under alert level three of the lockdown from June. Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has now announced that in addition to the 14 airports already permitted to operate, four more airports have been given the green light to resume operations under level two of the lockdown.
