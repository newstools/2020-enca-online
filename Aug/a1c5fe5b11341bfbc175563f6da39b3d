Boseman, who was in his 40s, had not publicly discussed his condition - which was first diagnosed in 2016 - and continued to work on major Hollywood films. "It was the honor of his career to bring King T'Challa to life in Black Panther," said a statement posted to Boseman's social media accounts. "He died in his home, with his wife and family by his side."
