This comes after Mashaba spent three years as Joburg mayor. In his speech, Mashaba promised to revitalise the economy through policies that result in growth. He also wants to abolish the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) programme. READ: I would never enter a coalition with ANC - Mashaba "BBBEE has not served anyone but the wealthy, politically-connected elite over and over and over again." It must be put in its rightful place in the rubbish dump of our history and must be replaced with a massive programme of investment into education and opportunity in areas where communities suffer from the legacy of our unjust past," Mashaba said. The former DA member called for the private sector to build affordable accommodation in cities. "We cannot sit back and allow our fellow South Africans to live in squalor in informal settlements across our country. We are going to reclaim our cities from criminal elements and offer these buildings to the private sector to build affordable accommodation for our people, students, and small businesses." He also said that there will be no space for cadre deployment or state entities that need bailouts. The new Action SA party plans to contest municipal elections next year.
