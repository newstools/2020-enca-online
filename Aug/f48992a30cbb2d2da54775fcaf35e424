READ: ANC talks tough on PPE tender fraud "We are saying to law enforcement agencies, do your work without favour or prejudice." What impact does COVID-19 corruption have on broader sentiment?

Courtesy #DStv403 "Do not be influenced by the media, don't be influenced by leaders, politicians, do your work objectively and I think that is the message we are saying but fight corruption wherever it is," he said.
