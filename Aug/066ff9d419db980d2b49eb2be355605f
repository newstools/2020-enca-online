JOHANNESBURG - Consumer price inflation increased to 3.2 percent year-on-year in August from 2.2 percent year-on-year in June. The latest data from StatsSA shows that inflation is back within the South African Reserve Bank's target range of between 3 percent and 6 percent annual inflation. This comes after two months of the lowest annual price increases since 2004.

Private transport operation costs were lower largely due to lower fuel prices. However, recent local fuel price increases have rolled back this benefit. Also, the cost of new vehicles increased by just under four percent year-on-year in July. While the price of electricity had little impact on inflation, Eskom recently won a court battle to raise its tariffs over the next three years. This poses a risk to the inflation outlook.
