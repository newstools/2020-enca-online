File: The rooster serves as the unofficial symbol of France and the emblem of its rugby and football teams. PRIVAS - A French rooster named Marcel has amassed over 74,000 signatures on a petition protesting against his early demise by the gun of a neighbour fed up with his crowing. The petition demanding "Justice for Marcel" was created by Sebastien Verney, the cockerel's owner and resident of Vinzieux, a village of 450 people in southern France left rattled by the killing in May this year. "We have been profoundly shocked by this tragedy," Verney told AFP. "The rural way of life is increasingly under attack from behaviour that is not punished." Verney's neighbour has admitted to shooting the bird.

The neighbour has been charged with animal cruelty and unlawful use of a weapon among other offences and is due to go on trial in December. An online petition for Marcel, with the subheading "Let us sing" had gathered more than 74,500 signatures by Monday. It describes the deceased bird as a proud defender of Verney's family home, "full of love for our children and bringing joy to our home, punctuating our daily life with his crowing and his beautiful presence in the henhouse". It is not the first time a fight over a rooster has galvanised the French.
