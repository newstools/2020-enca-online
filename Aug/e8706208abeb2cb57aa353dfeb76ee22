Ramaphosa told MPs during his quarterly question and answer session in Parliament that it was "disgraceful" and a "huge stench" that some companies sought to "criminally benefit" from a national crisis. But he vowed it would be "a watershed moment that marks the start of a new era in transparency and accountability in... procurement".

Fellow African leaders had told him they "are going through the same challenges," he said. The scramble to procure protective equipment like masks as the virus spread around the world "gave people with corrupt intent, fraudulent intent, an opportunity just to make quick buck and overcharge governments in many, many other countries".
