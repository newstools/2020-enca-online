If you thought last month’s load-shedding was a random occurrence, think again. Eskom is warning of more power outages in the weeks ahead. CEO Andre de Ruyter was speaking to the Cape Town Press Club today. Lindsay Dentlinger reports.

Eskom CEO Andre de Ruyter said the ongoing outages are necessary to catch up with long overdue maintenance.

I think there is a risk of load-shedding always in the system given the lack of predictability, reliability, the lack of maintenance that was not done. De Ruyter thinks Eskom has been doing a good job of managing the demand peaks and keeping the lights on.

De Ruyter said contrary to some public opinion, Eskom is making good progress in unbundling the company.

Municipal debt owed to Eskom now stands at R30-billion, with Soweto accounting for almost a third of that.
