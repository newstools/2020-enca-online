There has been an outcry over lack of communication from the department about the school's nutrition programme. Basic Education spokesperson, Elijah Mhlanga says all pupils will be provided with food regardless of whether classes are continuing.

"Parents also need to accompany their children when they go to school and collect their meals and we are saying it doesn't have to be a school where you attend but it can be any school near you," said Mhlanga. Last month, High Court in Pretoria ruled that government’s National School Nutrition Programme must immediately resume for all pupils after it was suspended when schools shut down in March.
