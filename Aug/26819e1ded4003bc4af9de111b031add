PARIS - The wearing of masks in some crowded areas around Paris became compulsory on Monday as part of a drive to stem a sharp rise in COVID-19 infections, but some tourists appeared perplexed about where the new rule is meant to apply. A detailed list of more than 100 mandatory mask-wearing zones includes the popular Montmartre district, with its narrow streets, and the banks of the River Seine but excludes other famous tourist destinations such as the Eiffel Tower, the Champs Elysees and the huge shopping area of Les Halles.

We're tourists so we don't know in which zones we're required to wear a mask," said Dominico Ditoma, a French tourist visiting Montmartre with his family. "We assume it's for tourist spots but there are no signs so it's quite unclear." Anybody aged 11 and over faces a 135 euro ($159) fine if caught without a mask where one is required.
