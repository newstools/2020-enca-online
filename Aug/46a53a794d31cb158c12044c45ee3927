The Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa in Kwazulu-Natal is concerned about rising COVID-19 cases in the province. Courtesy #DStv403 DURBAN - The Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (Denosa) is dissatisfied with KwaZulu-Natal's state of preparedness for COVID-19. Denosa says the number of infections continues to rise among health workers and that the health department doesn't have a tangible plan in place.

"The first case was in March in this province, but until now we see management moving at the same pace as they were moving when we had two people infected in this province, while now we are over 100,000. The practices and the manner at which they approach the virus remain the same with them."
