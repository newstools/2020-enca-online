File: At least 144 psychiatric patients died – after being moved from ill-equipped NGOs in 2016. JOHANNESBURG - The Special Investigating Unit says those responsible for the Life Esidimeni tragedy are not off the hook. Unit head Andy Mothibi says even those individuals who resigned from their positions may still face criminal or civil cases. "We have been on record as saying the phenomenon of people resigning in the face of an investigation is so widespread in the public sector.

Former Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu, former Health Head Barney Selebano, and former mental health head Makgabo Manamela are among those implicated. They were found to have broken their oaths of office by facilitating the move of 144 mental health patients from Life Esidimeni facilities to ill-equipped NGOs where they died. An inquiry led by former Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke concluded in 2018 found that government acted in breach of the law which ultimately resulted in their deaths.
