Those in the industry say it’s time for a more united fight against criminals. While the latest police crime stats show CIT robberies are down by 10 percent and the SA Banking Risk Information Centre confirms there’s been a five percent drop year-on-year, thieves are back, combing the streets.

"When the lockdown regulations were relaxed, we suddenly saw a dramatic increase in CIT robberies especially in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape, but Gauteng has been the hardest hit.” Earlier this month, Fidelity confirmed three separate attempted attacks on its cash vans in three different provinces, all in the space of 30 minutes.

Clark wants to formalise the association by year-end and bring roleplayers together so they can put up one coordinated fight against South Africa’s ongoing CIT heist problem. * eNCA reporter Graeme Raubenheimer filed this report.
