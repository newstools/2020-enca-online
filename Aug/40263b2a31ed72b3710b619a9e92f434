RICHARDS BAY - After conquering seven marathons on seven continents in seven days and reaching Mount Kilimanjaro, Nontuthuko Mgabhi is not done yet. Now she’s eyeing the North Pole marathon as she strives to raise funds for the “Go Beyond for A Girl Child” initiative. Mgabhi has always been an adrenaline junkie and from a young age she knew she was destined for greatness. Completing seven marathons seems gruelling for most athletes, but for Mgabhi it was right up her alley. "Just preparing for one marathon is hard business enough. Doing seven requires commitment," said Mgabhi. The Richards Bay-born star paid tribute to her coach Prodigal Khumalo, who is a two-time world tour ultra trail Cape Town record holder and multiple Comrades Marathon gold medalist. Through her experience, the marathon runner has been able to raise funds to build five classrooms at KZN’s Khiphinkuzi Primary School. Mgabhi hopes to inspire other women to chase their dreams. “I’m very passionate about women and children empowerment so I would love to truly inspire women to go out and do those things that are daring," she said. "Courage is not the absence of fear. You have to feel the fear and be brave."
