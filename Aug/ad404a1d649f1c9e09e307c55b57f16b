The Gauteng Provincial Command Council briefed the media on the province's response to COVID-19. "The province given the success of controlling the first surge and the hotspots, we are in the position to relax the lockdown," Mellado said. "Clearly there are different scenarios, the relaxation of the lockdown is a complex matter and from the mathematical standpoint and also based on experience from other countries, it is very clear whatever happens, and whatever configuration of that relaxation takes place, maybe performed gradually and phased away, overconfidence, unfortunately, doesn't pay off."
