Courtesy #DStv403  JOHANNESBURG - A car wash, a pub and a bakery - among the companies that received tenders to provide Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to government. The South African Revenue Service is investigating 300 companies awarded tenders worth R2-billion. Less than 30% of them are tax compliant.

Meanwhile, tenders worth R1.2-billion under investigation by Sars, were awarded to companies which are politically connected. “It’s all kinds of shenanigans that they play. Not declaring income from PPE even though they get it from the government, they still choose to cheat the government. They have outstanding tax returns, they file fraudulent or incorrect returns. They obtain tax certificates by fiddling the system, and they are not registered for VAT,” said Sars Commissioner Edward Kieswetter.
