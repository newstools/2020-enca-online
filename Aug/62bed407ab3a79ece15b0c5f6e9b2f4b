Under level 2 lockdown, booze sales are allowed but many businesses will find it difficult to reopen, having used up their savings to carry them through the dry spell. "It has been really difficult because we actually had to let go of a lot of our employees so we had to lose a lot of stock due to the expiry date and also not forgetting the fact that we lost our income. Level 2 lockdown: SA to resume alcohol, tobacco sales on Tuesday "We no longer getting income at all. We had to use our own savings to survive in the household," said tavern owner, Ntswaki Mojela. Mojela says a lot of money has been poured down the drain as the goods that could not be sold during lockdown have now expired. "Recovery is going to take a very long time. We don't believe that we should sit down and not open because at the end of the day, three months down the line we still won't have the savings that we need so it's better we open now." Alcohol sales were prohibited to ease pressure on hospitals, allowing doctors in emergency wards to focus on COVID-19 rather than road accidents and other alcohol-related injuries. Tobacco products were restricted because of the health impacts of smoking as well as the risk of contamination between people sharing cigarettes. Watch the video above for more on this story.
