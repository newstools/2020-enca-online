File: In June, South Africa piloted its first trial of a vaccine developed by the Britain-based Oxford Jenner Institute. JOHANNESBURG - South Africa will launch clinical trials of a US-developed coronavirus vaccine with 2,900 volunteers this week, the second such study, lead investigator Shabir Madhi said. Known as NVX-CoV2373, the vaccine was developed by US biotech company Novavax from the genetic sequence of SARS‑CoV‑2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease.

"It's a two-dose schedule, and they get two either vaccines or placebos... spaced three weeks apart," professor Madhi of the Johannesburg-based University of the Witwatersrand (Wits), told AFP. Since the country also accounts for 20 percent of global HIV infections according to UNAIDS 2020 data, 240 medically stable, HIV-positive adults will also participate in the clinical trial. "It's critical that we understand how these vaccines work in populations that have HIV, especially in South Africa where they constitute up to about 12 to 15 percent of the adult population," said Madhi.

Partly funded by a $15-million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the trials are part of a larger study to be launched throughout the world to involve approximately 30,000 participants. In June, South Africa piloted its first trial of a vaccine developed by the Britain-based Oxford Jenner Institute. Some 2,000 people were injected with the vaccine known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 with 50 of the candidates having HIV. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday.
