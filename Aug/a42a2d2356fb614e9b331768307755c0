Several South African players in the English Rugby Premiership opted against taking the knee when the tournament re-started last Friday. There has been divided opinion here at home, about the players’ stance. SA Rugby is adopting a cautious approach in their response to England based players after they decided not to take the knee last week.

In his response, CEO Jurie Roux says the matter will be discussed at the SARU exco. “The president has indicated that he will call a meeting with his exco, and that he will discuss the matter along with a lot of other matters that are topical in the media and he will respond to him, so I’m gonna give him the latitude to have that meeting,” Roux said. According to Roux, the position taken on Friday, especially by national players, should not affect team dynamics.

Meanwhile, Roux reiterated SA Rugby’s plan to address the movement and that involves consulting those within the organisation’s structures. He says SA Rugby’s formal position on recent developments will be stated, once the meeting of the organisation’s Exco has taken place.
