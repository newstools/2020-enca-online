File: EFF leader Julius Malema. JOHANNESBURG - Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema is calling for the closure of the Zimbabwean embassy in South Africa. Malema tweeted his call using the trending #ZimbabweanLivesMatter.  We call for the removal of the Zimbabwean Embassy in SA until they restore the human rights in that country. Failure to do so, we will prevent any official from the Zimbabwean government from participating in any gathering in SA until they respect ordinary Zimbabweans. More than 60 activists in Zimbabwe are either behind bars or in hiding.
