A forensic report has cleared Motsepe-Radebe and Ian Khama of any wrongdoing. They were accused of funding and masterminding the plot. READ: Botswana espionage case postponed A law firm probing the claims has found them to be nothing more than fake news. Khama and Motsepe-Radebe have always maintained it was merely a ploy to damage their reputations. Motsepe-Radebe hired International Law firm Omnia Strategy, which has now absolved her of any involvement in money laundering. WATCH: Motsepe-Radebe hits back over Botswana bank scandal The probe essentially rubbishes claims by the Botswana government, that Motsepe-Radebe and Khama had tried to fund a coup. Both Khama and Motsepe-Radebe have now vowed to sue the Botswana government. Meanwhile, AfriForum, who was appointed by the Botswana government to pursue a case against Motsepe, has vowed to continue pursuing Motsepe.
