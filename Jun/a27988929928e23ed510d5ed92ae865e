READ: Mass graves for COVID-19 deaths in Western Cape The province is preparing for the peak of the infection ahead of other provinces but it’s also struggling to convince people to isolate and quarantine in its facilities. Many fear the stigma of the diagnosis and don’t want to leave the creature comforts of home. A COVID-19 morgue comprising 12 refrigeration containers that can accommodate 770 bodies is being set up at Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town. COVID-19: Western Cape peak expected next week Premier Alan Winde says the next few weeks will be critical for a province with around 15,000 active coronavirus cases. “We are preparing for this, and we continue to prepare for this. Even the response from the Health Department, you would see that, some of our testing and triage facilities are not all in place, there are a couple in the rural areas that we are still putting place." "It’s about the health response, but also the citizen response. It’s about making sure we continue with our response as citizens to keep flattening the curve in whichever way we go about it." - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
