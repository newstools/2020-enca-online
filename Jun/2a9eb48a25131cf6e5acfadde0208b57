A church leader has called on white people to take a stand. “It’s not good enough for people to stand and say racism is wrong, but they have to stand up within their communities and say racism is wrong. So today I have invited 50 white people to come and say Black Lives Matter. And it is time white people stand up against racism in their white communities,” said Pastor Immanuel Landman from Elim Full Gospel Church.

While the gathering doesn’t compare to the thousands protesting elsewhere in the world, the message is the same. The deaths of Khosa and George has focused the world’s attention on racism and police brutality. Pastor Immanuel has challenged other churches and white religious leaders’ congregations, in particular, to lead reconciliation in South Africa.
