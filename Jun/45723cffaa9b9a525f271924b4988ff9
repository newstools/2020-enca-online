COVID-19: Under 19,000 prisoners to be released on parole "We are not looking at centres with severe overcrowding, to say how best do we alleviate that because there is a solution already and we have stated on several occasions that overcrowding is found in those centres which are in the metros and once the 19,000 is out then that will create some space," he said. The prisoners will be released on parole as part of efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 in prisons.
