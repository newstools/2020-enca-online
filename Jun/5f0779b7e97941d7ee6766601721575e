LONDON - London Marathon race director Hugh Brasher said on Friday that organisers are working to ensure the rescheduled race is held on 4 October despite the cancellation of September's Great North Run due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The cancellation of the annual half marathon had raised doubts about the London Marathon going ahead due to the challenges faced by organisers in implementing social distancing protocols.

However, it doesn't," Brasher said in an open letter to runners. "The team at London Marathon Events has been looking at the logistics... and coming up with innovative ways to socially distance the event. "We have also been working with other mass participation event organisers in the UK, including the Great Run Company and Human Race, to make recommendations to the UK government on how mass participation events can return."

"There is still plenty of time to train and there is neither a need, nor should there be a desire, to be at your peak fitness yet," he added. "I assure you that whatever decision we take... it will be taken in line with our values and with the responsibility we have to you, our runners, our charities, our sponsors, our volunteers, our medics, our communities and our city."
