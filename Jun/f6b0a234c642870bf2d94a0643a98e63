A family in the Eastern Cape has buried relatives who died from COVID-19. Courtesy of #DStv403 eNCA reporter Aviwe Mtila covered a story of an Eastern Cape family who buried two of their loved ones the same day. On Wednesday morning, 3 June, the family gathered to mourn two of their loved ones. The family watched from afar as the coffins of Nomakhasazana Soyizwaphi (70) and her daughter-in-law Lungiswa Soyizwaphi were sprayed with disinfectant before being lowered into the ground. It was a quick funeral, a sign of the times of COVID-19. Nomakhasazana was admitted to Life St Mary's Hospital on 11 May for diabetes-related treatment and was discharged one week later. Nomakhasazana took care of her mother-in-law and it's suspected that both women contracted COVID-19. On 28 May, Nomakhasazana was readmitted to St Mary's Hospital. She died the very next day. Lungiswa sought treatment at a public hospital on 28 May and died three days later.
