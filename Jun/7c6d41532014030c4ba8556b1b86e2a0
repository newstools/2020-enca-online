A relief fund has been established for people working in the transport sector to help ease the burden caused by COVID-19. Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula outlines who will qualify and how the aid can be obtained. JOHANNESBURG - The South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) says it's unhappy at the amount government is offering as part of a relief package for the taxi industry. Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula announced a relief fund of over R1-billion for the industry. Mbalula says this will translate into around R5,000 for taxi owners.

"But where we are heading to, it is the long-term subsidisation of this industry and formalisation." The minister says taxi bosses have already told him they’re not happy and he’s warned against any planned shutdown by the industry.

"But we believe that if properly exploited, they could serve as an opportunity to augment the current situation we find ourselves in.”
