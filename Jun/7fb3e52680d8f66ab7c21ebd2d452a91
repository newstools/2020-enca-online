File: The sale of cigarettes remains prohibited under alert level 3. PRETORIA - A Fita application to have cigarettes deemed essential services during the lockdown has been dismissed. The Pretoria High Court said a product's addictive properties do not mean it can be deemed essential during the lockdown. READ: Legal battle over tobacco ban delayed until August The court stated it found no basis on which to interpret the Level 5 regulations as permitting the sale of tobacco products. The applicants made the argument that the prohibition of cigarettes was irrational and also gave no consideration to harm on the economy, employment, livelihoods, and the health and safety of individuals. WATCH: Exposing illegal cigarette sales In their application, Fita said, "it is undeniable that simply and summarily preventing smokers and users of tobacco products from using these products gives rise to very serious physical and emotional adverse consequences. This leads to many users resorting to illicit non-regulated products that pose a significant health hazard." The High Court said cigarettes and related tobacco products do not, by their nature, fall into the same category as goods which are life-sustaining or necessary for basic functionality and sn interpretation of the regulations to expand to such a meaning would be insupportable. Fita said it will be appealing the judgment. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
