Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Finance Minister Tito Mboweni has painted a bleak picture for the economy in his response to the debate on the national budget in the National Assembly on Friday. The country is in recession and tax revenue is weak. It is time, as Mboweni says, to adapt to the new situation. READ: President Ramaphosa asked to rein in Mboweni South Africa can expect a big change in the budgeting process going forward. Mboweni has asked government departments to get used to zero-based budgeting. That's when all expenses must be justified for each new period. Budgets are then built around what is needed for the coming period, regardless of whether each budget is higher or lower than the previous one. "We are no longer as rich as we used to think we are. We have to adapt to the new situation. The new situation, in my view, requires that we think seriously about going to zero-based budgeting, in other words, refocus our attention on strategic issues and refocus on growth-enhancing activities," he said. Mboweni says the balancing act going forward is now trickier than ever.
