He says rapists and killers walk among us and have no regard for the sanctity of life. "Of course, it is not alcohol that rapes or kills a woman or a child," Ramaphosa said. "Rather, it is the actions of violent men but if alcohol intoxication is contributing to these crimes, then it must be addressed with urgency. "We need to draw the lessons from this lockdown and decide how we can protect our society from the abuse of alcohol. "Certainly, we need to provide greater support to people with drinking problems, including through rehabilitation and treatment." The president says responsible drinking needs to be encouraged especially among the youth.

Ultimately, the success of our fight to end gender-based violence will require the involvement and support of our entire society."
