Acting CEO Tebogo Montlanthe says Ria Ledwaba was dismissed after she violated the association's constitution. Courtesy  #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The South African Football Association claims they followed the right procedure when they axed long term Vice President Ria Ledwaba, along with former acting CEO Gay Mokoena. The governing body held an extraordinary NEC meeting on Saturday, where the resolution on the two officials was taken. Acting CEO Tebogo Motlanthe says Ria Ledwaba was dismissed after she violated the association's constitution after Ledwaba wrote a letter to Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa, in which she questioned President Danny Jordaan's leadership style. According to Ledwaba she tried to raise this matter with Jordaan, but with no luck.

The NEC said we have elected you and as people who have elected you first, we find it wrong for you to involve third parties in the issues of Safa," said Motlanthe. "You had many avenues you could have written directly to us, as NEC members, and say these are the issues I have addressed with the President before you can even go outside to the government, in particular, knowing the FIFA position on the involvement of Government."
Motlanthe said she could have explored other avenues before going to the Minister. The association is obliged to appoint another female member to the vice president position. They may no longer occupy the positions of vice president but both Ledwaba and Mokoena remain members of the SAFA NEC.
