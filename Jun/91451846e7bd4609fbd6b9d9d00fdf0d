Courtesy of #DStv403 SOSHANGUVE - Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula was rushed away from a visit to engage with aggrieved taxi drivers on Monday. Mbalula was attempting to cool tempers as taxi operators embarked on a demonstration to highlight concerns within the industry, including accessing subsidies for loss of business during the lockdown. Taxi owners had asked for a minimum of R20,000 each but the government is offering R5,000 and wants the taxi sector formalised.

Mbalula addressed a crowd on Monday afternoon amid reports of drivers blocking roads and intimidating motorists. The minister was fielding questions when his security team deemed the crowd a security risk and transported Mbalula away with a police escort.

Some concerns raised by the protesters are that they cannot keep up with repayments on their vehicles and banks are threatening to repossess their source of income. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
