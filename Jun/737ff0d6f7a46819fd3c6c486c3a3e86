File: Captains AB de Villiers, Quinton de Kock and Kagiso Rabada will lead teams of eight players. CAPE TOWN - Cricket South Africa will trial a new format that will see three teams compete in a single 36-over match as they look to re-start the game with the Solidarity Cup at SuperSport Park in Centurion on June 27. The fixture is a chance for the country's leading players to get some game-time under their belts in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, but will also raise funds for charity. It will be played in an empty stadium and is a test for CSA's protocols for a return to play for the domestic game, which could come as early as next month.
