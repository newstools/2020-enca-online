File: Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula. JOHANNESBURG - Transport Minister, Fikile Mbalula says the reality is that government has no more funds available to offer the taxi industry. Mbalula briefed the media following reports of a planned taxi shutdown in Gauteng on Monday. The association is opposing the government's R1.135-billion relief package, saying it is not enough. READ: Taxi shutdown for Gauteng on Monday "Increasing the amount that is available is simply not an option on the table. I wish to repeat, the door is still open for creative ideas to maximise value for this limited benefit for all operators in the industry," he said. Mbalula says a strike will worsen will worsen the devastation felt by the industry. "That is why this shutdown is counter-productive and is not good for Santaco, it's not good for the taxi industry and it is not good for all of us," he added.
