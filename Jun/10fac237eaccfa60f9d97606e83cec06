Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Government is saying don't puff and pass during the COVID-19 lockdown, banning the sale of tobacco products but the thriving black market is heating up with illegal cigarette sellers making a killing. A recent survey by the University of Cape Town revealed that more than 90-percent of smokers continue to light up. It’s an open secret where one can get cigarettes during the lockdown in downtown Johannesburg. The Checkpoint team was led to a man selling South African manufactured smokes for nearly double the price. Outside the lockdown, a loose RG cigarette is normally sold at 50 cents, and Courtleigh loose costs R3 but during the lockdown, the latter costs R7.
