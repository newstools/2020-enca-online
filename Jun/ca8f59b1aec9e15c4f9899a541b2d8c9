Santaco in the Western Cape says it will not be increasing taxi fares for now. Although many taxi associations say they are unhappy with the government's relief fund, the plight of the everyday commuter has been a top priority in discussions. Courtesy of #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Most Cape Town commuters can breathe a sigh of relief – for now – as there’s no taxi fare increase on the cards. In Johannesburg, thousands of commuters were left stranded due to a taxi shutdown as the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) rejected government’s R1.1-billion relief fund for the industry. Santaco in the Western Cape said various interventions by the provincial government -- like contracting operators to transport healthcare workers -- has brought some relief.

"After long and extensive discussions with them they have now persuaded not to increase, but [couple] of them said they will have a slight adjustment that will also not be so hard on the community.” READ: Santaco says relief fund insufficient But taxi bosses in the Western Cape agree with the Gauteng counterparts that the relief fund is too little. “We believe there are more sustainable ways of dealing with the loss that the industry is making," said Transport MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela.
