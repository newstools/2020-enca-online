Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Health Minister Zweli Mkhize says it is possible that areas with lower COVID-19 infection levels could be moved to Level 2 or 1 soon. To date, more than 58,000 people have contracted the coronavirus and over 33,000 of them have recovered. "It is a matter of adjusting. As we adjust further, it will be possible to get to those levels," Mkhize said.

"These low transmission areas are areas where the number of positive people is low," he said. Mkhize said government may have to consider banning the sale of alcohol again.

"However, there may well even arise a situation where we might feel the numbers of beds are compromised by the fact that there is too much of trauma. "The records that we have, show that there has been a lot of relief when the alcohol was not being easily available." - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday.
