PARIS - Six-time world champion Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas will return to the track next week, spending two days at Silverstone testing protocols ahead of the start of the coronavirus-hit Formula One season. "We'll be back on track next week @SilverstoneUK!" the Mercedes team tweeted on Thursday. "Valtteri (Tuesday) and Lewis (Wednesday) will drive the 2018 Mercedes W09 in a two-day test as the team practises protocols ahead of returning to racing in Austria next month."    The curtailed Formula One season will start with two races behind closed doors in Austria on July 5 and July 12 followed by six other grands prix in Europe. Formula One said it hoped to have between 15 and 18 races in total, with the season being completed in December.
