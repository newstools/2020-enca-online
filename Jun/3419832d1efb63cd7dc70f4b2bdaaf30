While the new coronavirus spreads all over the world, there is only one continent that still breathes relieved: Antarctica. Due to strict control measures and a little luck, the territory remains free from contagion. WELLINGTON - New Zealand said it will reduce its scientific projects in Antarctica to keep the virtually uninhabited continent free from COVID-19. Antarctica New Zealand, the government agency that does environmental research on the desolate landmass and the Southern Ocean, said limiting the number of people visiting was key to stopping the spread of the coronavirus. The agency said it had decided to support "only long-term science monitoring, essential operational activity and planned maintenance this season" at its Scott Base after consulting other research programmes in the region.

"Antarctica New Zealand is committed to maintaining and enhancing the quality of New Zealand's Antarctic scientific research," Chief Executive Sarah Williamson said. "However, current circumstances dictate that our ability to support science is extremely limited this season."

Scott Base is New Zealand's only Antarctic research station and is 3,800km south of Christchurch and 1,350km from the South Pole, according to Antarctica New Zealand. Up to 86 scientists, staff and visitors can usually stay there at any one time.
