Hundreds of people -- believed to be from a neighbouring village -- destroyed crops and millions of rands in farming equipment on Sunday. Itâ€™s believed to be an act of retaliation after a trespasser drowned on the property on Saturday. The neighbouring community became angry after his body was recovered. Police are investigating.
