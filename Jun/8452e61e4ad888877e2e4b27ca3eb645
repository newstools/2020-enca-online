The rail, port and pipeline company says over two million litres of petroleum products have been stolen from the pipelines. Transnet has called on all stakeholders involved in the petroleum value chain to join efforts in the fight against fuel theft from South Africa’s valuable pipeline infrastructure.

It says this is to curb the demand for illegal petroleum products. “It also poses a danger to nearby communities, due to the inherent dangers of tampering with high-pressure petroleum pipelines, which could result in fire incidents, causing serious injuries and/or fatalities to the perpetrators and communities.” READ: Transnet avails facilities for quarantine sites In addition to increased security measures along the pipeline, Transnet says it is working with the Hawks, National Crime Intelligence and the police. “Such partnership continues to yield positive results with a number of breakthroughs in the form of arrests and impounding of vehicles and fuel tankers recorded,” Transnet said in a statement.
