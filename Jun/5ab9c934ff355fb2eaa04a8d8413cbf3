JOHANNESBURG - The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has urged Parliament to move swiftly to start the process of amending the Electoral Act.

Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi told Parliament’s portfolio committee that there is no reason to approach the courts for an extension just yet. He says a Cabinet committee will have to be set up to consider a new electoral system that accommodates the changes.

Such a move, it says, is also likely to come at a considerable cost. The IEC says it can only get to work once Parliament drafts the necessary legislation.
