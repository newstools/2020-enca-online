Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - The Ministry of Justice and Correctional Services has asked the public protector to investigate why a Cape Town mother was not assisted to get a protection order. Altecia Kortje and her seven-year-old daughter were murdered just a week after she allegedly tried to get the protection order against her boyfriend and the father of her two children. Altecia and Raynecia went missing for a few days and relatives went to the house where Altecia’s boyfriend, Ryan Smith, lived.

Both the mom and daughter had several stab wounds. Van Der Poll says Altecia had left her boyfriend a week ago and had gone to their house to fetch their two children - Raynecia and their nine-month-old baby. The baby was not in the house at the time.

The matter is now in the hands of the Public Protector. “She could have been alive today if they had assisted her in the first place. And how many of this is still going to happen?” Van Der Poll said. She says she is against gender-based violence and the fact that a family member has been arrested for the murders, makes it very difficult to deal with.
