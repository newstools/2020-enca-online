It's all contained in The Accidental Mayor --- a memoir that has just been published, written by Mashaba's former chief of staff Michael Beaumont. READ: Herman Mashaba reveals plans for new political party One of the 19 chapters of the 234-page memoir is almost entirely dedicated to the DA. He claims his caucus in the council treated him appallingly, and some were latent racists. The book captures Zille's numerous attempts to reach out to Mashaba soon thereafter, all of which were testily rebuffed by the former mayor.
