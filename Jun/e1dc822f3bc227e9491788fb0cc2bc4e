READ: Motshekga apologises for postponing schools' readiness briefing “Based on these reports, it became clear that the sector was at different levels of readiness. In the main, it was for this reason that the CEM determined that the sector requires more time to mop-out its state of readiness for school reopening, in order to comply with the health and safety standards on COVID-19,” said Motshekga. The council resolved the following: • Teachers, whose schools have already received the personal protective equipment, will be expected report for work on 01 June 2020, and prioritise the preparation of their schools to deal with the “new normal” brought about by the coronavirus;
 
• Provinces should finalise all their outstanding deliveries of PPEs to schools, and the outstanding provision of water and sanitation to the schools; Reopening of schools: Dates announced for other grades
 
• The ongoing cleaning of schools should be finalised within the week of 01 June 2020;
 
• All teachers and support staff should be inducted and orientated for the new environment brought about by the COVID-19;
 
• In return, the teachers should induct, orientate and counsel the learners, who have already arrived at the schools, to deal with the new COVID-19 environments;
 
• Provinces should finalise the training of screeners, cleaners and volunteers for the national school nutrition programme ; 
 
• Processes related to independent schools, small schools and schools for learners with special education needs, should be managed with the representatives of these sectors.
