The official opposition party wants the ban on personal care services to be overturned. The DA argues that hundreds of livelihoods are at stake. "The reality is that the devastation from the continued economic lockdown will see more lives lost than the virus could ever harm," DA Interim Leader John Steenhuisen said. "Government must stop driving fear and empower people to work and protect themselves and their livelihoods."
