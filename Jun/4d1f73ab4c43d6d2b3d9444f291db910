The leadership of Zimbabwe's main opposition, Movement for Democratic Change, is still in contention. READ: Zim opposition party's factional battles A court recently ruled that Thokozani Khupe was the rightful interim leader of the MDC-T that was led by Morgan Tsvangirai before his death. The battle has seen nine more MP's representing Chamisa's MDC Alliance recalled from Parliament by Khupe. Chamisa says Khupe is doing President Emmerson Mnangagwa's bidding to destroy the MDC Alliance.
