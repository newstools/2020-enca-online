PSL Chairperson Irvin Khoza says he is hoping that the Absa Premiership will be concluded by the 30th of June 2020. JOHANNESBURG - The Premier Soccer League is in a race against time to resume football. PSL Chairman Irvin Khoza says they have until the 30th of June to come up with plans to conclude the season. The pressure for resumption comes after long term sponsors Absa announced the end of their partnership with the PSL. The banking group had been the PSL’s sponsor for the past 16 years, helping the league become one of the most respected football championships in the world. “The contract was for 3 years - it was not pulling out, it was the expiry of the contract which again was a question of deciding on whether they continue or not continue."
