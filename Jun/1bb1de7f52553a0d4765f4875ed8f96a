More tertiary education students are expected back in class in a phased manner in the coming weeks. JOHANNESBURG - The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) has denied the Democratic Alliance's claims that it's writing-off about R1.96-billion in historic student debt. Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande has clarified the controversial matter. He says the money the DA is referring to, was part of R7-billion in irregular expenditure. Nzimande says the DA is making irresponsible statements amidst a crisis. "It looks like they are running out of issues during this lockdown. You cannot publish such irresponsible statements when in the middle of a virus. it just causes so much confusion in uncertainty in the system. That is irresponsible. I strongly condemn this behaviour," Nzimande said. Nzimande briefed the media on progress in the implementation of COVID-19 measures on Tuesday. The national COVID-19 death toll is at 1,080. South Africa's total number of confirmed cases is now at 50,879. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday.
