People flocked back to some of Thailand's famed sandy beaches on Monday as authorities lifted coronavirus restrictions for the first time in more than two months. PATTAYA - People returned to some of Thailand's famed sandy beaches on Monday, keeping well apart but enjoying the outdoors, as authorities eased some coronavirus restrictions for the first time in more than two months. In Pattaya, visitors marvelled at the clarity of the turquoise-blue waters of the Gulf of Thailand, as pensioners eager for exercise promenaded along the beach. Social distancing rules still applied, with local authorities ordering beachgoers to stay at least a metre (three feet) apart.

Phuket, in the south, is still off-limits, while sleepy Hua Hin remained open throughout. Thailand has been under various lockdown restrictions since mid-March, when authorities declared a state of emergency against the coronavirus -- shuttering malls, leisure centres and public spaces, including its famed beaches. READ: Thailand tourist arrivals in February fall due to coronavirus The exodus of foreigners and a ban on new arrivals hit the economy hard -- particularly as the country is so reliant on tourist dollars in resorts such as Pattaya. Tourism revenues dropped by 40 percent in the first three months of the year, and the government has warned the virus' impact on the second quarter will be more severe. A major tourist destination with an infamous nightlife and red-light district, Pattaya has turned into a virtual ghost town. Bars and clubs remain shuttered, however, and it is not clear when normal activity will resume.
