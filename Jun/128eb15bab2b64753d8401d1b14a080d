Local fuel producers say there's been a sharp increase in demand after months of lockdown and it's caught them by surprise. John Purchase, the CEO of the Agricultural Business Chamber, expressed his scepticism that the increase in demand is unexpected.

He stated that while there is a record-setting harvest in the fields, there is a major problem in obtaining enough fuel to transport the product to silos, mills, exports, and distributors. Purchase called for an inquiry by the Department of Mineral Resources particularly into rations of diesel supplies to farmers.
