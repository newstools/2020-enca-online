The Special Investigating Unit has uncovered rampant corruption in both that province and Gauteng.

The SIU told Parliament on Tuesday it's already in the process of challenging the validity of judgments in the Eastern Cape. READ: Financial fraud: By you and against you Head of the SIU Andy Mothibi said "the assessment of our team is that these judgments should not have been granted or given, had the state attorney done its work properly, as a result of this, we are already at court. "The first date was in May, but because of COVID-19, the date will be rescheduled. We have already filed the papers. "We want all these judgments rescinded because we are of the view that they do not serve the public interest if they are to be left unchallenged."
