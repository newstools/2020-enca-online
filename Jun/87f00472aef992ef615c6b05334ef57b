READ: Western Cape escalates COVID-19 response Western Cape premier, Alan Winde says the risk-adjusted strategy was adopted due to the backlog and shortage in test kits. ‘Initially what we will do is that we will keep those tests to people who are over 55 and are at risk. We will focus on our elderly and old age homes and people who are at risk,” said Winde.
