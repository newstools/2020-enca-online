Despite having 70 percent possession at Goodison Park on Sunday, the champions-elect managed just three shots on target, the same number as Everton, on their return to action after three months' absence. Carlo Ancelotti's team became just the third side this season to take points off Liverpool, who have won 27 of their 30 games. Klopp knows he cannot expect too much, too soon after the coronavirus pandemic-enforced break. "I liked the intensity level of the game from my boys, the high press, but I didn't like too much the rhythm -- but we cannot force that," he said.
