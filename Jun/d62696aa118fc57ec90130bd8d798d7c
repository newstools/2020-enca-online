Taxi associations have rejected government's proposed R1-billion cash injection. JOHANNESBURG - Santaco is set to announce a decision it has taken after failed meetings with Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula. The much-publicised meeting between the transport minister and taxi associations, already postponed twice, is now off. Santaco said its national leadership held a meeting on Saturday which considered the implications of the postponement of the planned meeting with Mbalula. The meeting was expected to iron out the taxi relief deadlock.
