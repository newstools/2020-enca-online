That’s according to residents who say, many schools don’t have enough personal protective gear yet, to make sure teachers and pupils are protected. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Mpumalanga residents say many schools in the province cannot reopen next week because they do not have enough personal protective gear for pupils and teachers. Masihambisane Higher Primary School is one of the schools not ready to open. The school principal says they are relying on the Education Department for help. READ: Motshekga outlines reasons for delaying reopening of schools "Our view is that we move at the same pace, where if one school opens then it means all schools are opening. There is no way we are going to allow rich schools to open, while poor schools are lagging behind," said Principal Vusi Lukhele. Residents in this township say schools should not reopen until all safety measures are in place. Meanwhile, Mpumalanga education MEC, Bonakele Majuba says schools in the province will be ready to open. "Definitely, we think schools will reopen on Monday, especially by looking at the example of this school, which is ready and all that is left is that teachers must be orientated and be trained." - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
