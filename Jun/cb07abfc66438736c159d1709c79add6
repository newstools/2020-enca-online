Bishop Bavin School, which is run by the Anglican Church, has suddenly shut its doors, apparently due to financial difficulties, leaving pupils with nowhere to go. Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Dean of Johannesburg, the Very Reverend Xolani Dlwathi, said Bishop Bavin School is separate from the Anglican Church. The school closed on 10 June, apparently due to financial difficulties. Parents and teachers held a picket outside the institution, hoping for answers. Dlwathi commented on the situation, saying the school is run separately as an NPO by its board and is separate from the Anglican Church. The school reportedly sent letters to parents, assuring them the school's future was not in question and that the Anglican Church remained committed to providing pupils with an education of the highest calibre.

That is why to date, as the church, we have provided about R15-million of the church's money," Dlwathi said. "Over the years there have been intentional interventions, turnaround strategies, mechanisms and it was based on that that the church also financially supported the school." Dlwathi said a letter sent to parents on 30 May, may have reassured them of the school's continued operation. But when a new team took charge, they found the financial situation at the school was more serious than they initially thought. The Dean said the school has no money and as such, teacher's salaries have not been paid in full. The parents and teachers are seeking legal advice.
