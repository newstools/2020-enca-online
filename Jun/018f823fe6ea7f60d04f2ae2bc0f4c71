Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Reserve Bank Governor, Lesetja Kganyago says the central bank will release apartheid-era records following a recent court ruling. Last week, the South African History Archive won a six-year long court battle against the bank. "When we had an exchange with the organisation that was looking for the information, we were very clear that the nature of their request was vague and when they approached the court, we felt that we should go to the court to get clarification.

The records relate to the bank's investigation of individuals implicated in apartheid-era financial crimes.
