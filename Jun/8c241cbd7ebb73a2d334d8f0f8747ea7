Former president FW De Klerk arrives during the annual State of the Nation (SONA) address and opening of the national parliament in Cape Town on February 13, 2020. JOHANNESBURG - The American Bar Association has cancelled a speech by former president FW de Klerk. He was supposed to speak on a range of issues, including the rule of law, racism and constitutional democracy. The ABA made the decision after objections from Truth and Reconciliation Commissioners, human rights activists and the son of Fort Calata, one of the slain Cradock Four. Calata's son Lukhanyo was the first to call for the cancellation, saying De Klerk's hands are dripping with blood.
