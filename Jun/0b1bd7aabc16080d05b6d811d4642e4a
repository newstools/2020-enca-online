SAN FRANCISCO - Microsoft said it will close its stores around the world, moving its retail operations online and keeping only four locations that will be transformed into "experience centres." The move means the estimated 100 Microsoft stores closed due to the coronavirus pandemic will not reopen as the tech giant enters "a new approach to retail," according to a statement. "Microsoft will continue to invest in its digital storefronts on Microsoft.com, and stores in Xbox and Windows, reaching more than 1.2 billion people every month in 190 markets," the statement said.
