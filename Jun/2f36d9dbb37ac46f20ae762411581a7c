MIAMI - US Ryder Cup captain Steve Stricker will have six selections for his team under revised American selection criteria for September's scheduled showdown with Europe.

The Americans are scheduled to entertain holders Europe on September 25-27 at Whistling Straits in Kohler, Wisconsin.

Points will now be compiled through the BMW Championship on August 30, with Stricker announcing his six picks, rather than four as first planned, on September 2 or 3. "With all the various changes to the 2020 schedule, it quickly became apparent that we would need to amend our selection criteria," Stricker said.

"These changes were sparked by circumstance, but conceived with integrity in mind. In the end, we believe they will allow us to put our best team together to compete at Whistling Straits in September." The revamped selection process was no assurance the Cup would be contested as planned, with talks continuing with the European Tour about a possible postponement or playing the event without spectators. The statement said the new process assumes "all such events and the 2020 Ryder Cup take place as currently scheduled."
