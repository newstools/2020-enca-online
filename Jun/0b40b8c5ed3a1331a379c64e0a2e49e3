The Huawei P40 Lite, launched in SA on 18 May 2020. SPONSORED - Today’s social media is heavily focused on pictures and videos, which mean your photography and videography game needs to be on point. Investing in a professional camera setup is not really an option, as it’s expensive, and often very complicated to learn. Smartphone photography with your HUAWEI P40 lite is a much easier solution, one where taking memorable photos and videos is as simple as point and click. The new HUAWEI P40 lite comes with four cameras in its 48MP AI Quad camera setup. This includes the 48MP main camera for high resolution pictures and videos, a 8MP ultra-wide angle lens for 120 degree field of view, a 2MP macro lens for detailed close-ups and a 2MP bokeh lens for portrait shots. You also get a great selfie camera and, to make things even easier, a powerful AI system to help you take even better pictures. Here are a few tips on what you can do to take some great photos with this device and improve your social media presence.  Huawei’s app store, HUAWEI AppGallery, boasts access to all the social media apps you need and provides top-notch security and privacy while still helping to make you famous. If this app platform doesn’t have a particular app you need, however, then you can simply phone clone it from your old device. Follow these tips and the stunning photos taken by your HUAWEI P40 lite will be the secret ingredients to building an enviable social media profile.
