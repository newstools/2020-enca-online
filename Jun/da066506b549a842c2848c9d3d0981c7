Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Judge Kate Pillay has delivered her judgment on a trial date for former president Jacob Zuma's French arms deal. Pillay has decided that the matter will be heard in court on 8 September. Zuma appeared in court for a pre-trial hearing in the High Court in Pietermaritzburg. State Prosecutor Billy Downer says the delays by Zuma’s legal team are unfair as they’ve had more than enough time to prepare.

Zuma's defence team says his client has long been crucified and it's unfair that they are being accused of dragging their feet. Zuma is accused of receiving bribes from French arms company Thales. His first appearance related to this case was in 2005.
