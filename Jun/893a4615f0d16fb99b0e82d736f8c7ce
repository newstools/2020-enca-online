Courtesy #DStv403 KWAZULU-NATAL - Supporters of former president Jacob Zuma say they still have his back – but won’t be flocking to Pietermaritzburg for his court appearance. Zuma's due to return to the KwaZulu-Natal High Court sitting in Pietermaritzburg for his pre-trial on Tuesday. He will appear alongside French arms company Thales. He's facing charges related to the controversial multibillion-rand arms deal of the late1990s. READ: Zuma in court for pre-trial hearing After nearly two decades, the State versus Zuma is finally ready for a showdown in court. In the past, Zuma's enjoyed massive support from a group of die-hard defenders. Tuesday’s proceedings are mainly for a pre-trial – meaning all parties will iron out logistical issues ahead of the start of the actual trial. The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal has meanwhile re-assured the former president.
