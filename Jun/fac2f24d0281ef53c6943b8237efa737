This is my grandmother who at the age of 88 passed away due to COVID-19. She was a feisty women who taught me to speak my mind and never let anyone walk all over you! She fought to the very end! She is survived by her son Gregory, Daughter Cheryl, 5 grandchildren and 6 great grandchildren! Always in our hearts, never forget! RIP GG. Submitted by Carey-Anne Diamond
