SAN FRANCISCO - Snap Inc said it would no longer promote US President Donald Trump's account in Snapchat's Discover section, saying his incendiary comments last week made the account ineligible for the curated section where users explore new content. "We will not amplify voices who incite racial violence and injustice by giving them free promotion on Discover," the company said in a statement. "Racial violence and injustice have no place in our society and we stand together with all who seek peace, love, equality, and justice in America."

In a statement, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale accused Snap of trying to rig the election by promoting Biden while suppressing Trump's content. He said Snap promoted "extreme left riot videos" and encouraged users to "destroy America". Snap said the Discover section features voices across the political spectrum, including both Republicans and Democrats.

The company said its decision to remove the president's content from Discover was made over the weekend.
