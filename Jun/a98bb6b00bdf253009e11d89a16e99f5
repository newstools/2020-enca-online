File: The eagerly awaited visit by the Lions is scheduled for July and August 2021. JOHANNESBURG - World champions South Africa may change the dates of a three-Test series against the British and Irish Lions next year, national body chief executive Jurie Roux said. The eagerly awaited visit is scheduled for July and August 2021 and the Tests in Soweto, Cape Town and Johannesburg clash with the rearranged Tokyo Olympics. But a possible new, post-coronavirus pandemic global rugby calendar could see the tour dates change rather than the Games in Japan.

"It would be a disappointment if the Lions series had to be played behind closed doors," he added, referring to the current crowd-less sport situation to combat the COVID-19 disease. There has been speculation about northern and southern hemisphere rugby date changes, including staging the Six Nations and Rugby Championship in March and April.

SA Rugby is hoping to get the green light from the sports ministry in mid-June to permit a resumption of training. Roux hoped two Tests against Scotland and one with Georgia, originally scheduled for next month, might be played during October.

Roux said a November tour by the Springboks, consisting of Tests in Italy, Ireland, France and Wales, was still on the cards.
