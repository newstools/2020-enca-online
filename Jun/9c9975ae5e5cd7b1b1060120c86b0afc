Courtesy of #DStv403 MTHATHA - Maintaining social distance, an Eastern Cape family on Wednesday morning gathered to mourn two of their loved ones. The family watched from afar as the coffins of Nomakhasazana Soyizwaphi (70) and her daughter-in-law Lungiswa Soyizwaphi were sprayed with disinfectant before being lowered into the ground. A neighbour said a quick prayer for these two women who -- according to family -- loved going to church.
