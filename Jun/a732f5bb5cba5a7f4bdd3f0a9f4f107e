Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Instituting restrictions on alcohol consumption may be needed if South African hospitals are under pressure. That's the view of Professor Salim Abdool Karim, Chairperson of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on COVID-19. According to Karim, "the problems of alcohol consumption is that you begin to utilise keys services that are reacquired by COVID-19 patients."

All in all, it poses a problem." Meanwhile, Police Minister Bheki Cele says there is sufficient evidence to warrant the banning of alcohol sales once more. "I have said it all the time that if I were given the opportunity to run and decide alone on this matter, then my first prize would be to ban the alcohol because I believe there is a lot of evidence that it is not doing good," he said.
