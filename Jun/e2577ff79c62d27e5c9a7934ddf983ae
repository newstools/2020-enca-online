Cricket great Sachin Tendulkar said playing in cold countries will diminish the option of using sweat. NEW DELHI - Brett Lee and Sachin Tendulkar have stepped up pressure for an alternative to saliva to be allowed for shining the cricket ball. The International Cricket Council is expected to order a temporary ban on using spit for shining as part of measures to get the sport restarted during the coronavirus pandemic. Fast bowlers make the ball swing in the air by shining one side with saliva or sweat. Sweat would still be allowed but is considered less effective.

Tendulkar said playing in cold countries will diminish the option of using sweat. "You are not going to sweat," he said naming New Zealand, Ireland and England.

I can't forget the game I played in Hove, I had five layers on me." Australian ball manufacturer Kookaburra is developing a wax applicator to shine the ball, but the world body is reluctant to allow artificial aids. Lee, a two-time World Cup winner, said bowlers should be given some leeway by umpires, including getting "two or three warnings" about using saliva before action is taken. "Because I can guarantee you, if the players are told they can't do it, they won't do it on purpose but I think it will happen through that natural instinct."
