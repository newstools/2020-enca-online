In the Western Cape, the first trains will travel between Cape Town and Retreat. But there are already concerns about whether or not the Central Line will be operational. READ: Metrorail to resume services The already beleaguered rail service has also been affected by the lockdown. Around one million commuters were travelling on the Central Line before it closed down. Vandalism and arson have largely contributed to the demise of this route. READ: Prasa: We have no money Prasa's plans to refurbish the Central Line have been disrupted by the lockdown. It's for this reason that the MEC of Transport in the province says the embattled rail agency should be given more time to fix it. “I would rather have those delays and make sure that we do a proper job and also make sure that we adhere to the new norm in terms of social distancing instead of having a rush job and stop the services again,” said Bonginkosi Madikizela.

Commuters are hoping this investment will get the line back on track sooner rather than later.
