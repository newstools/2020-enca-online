File: The tiger was first trapped in December 2018 after its long journey and held in captivity for two months. NEW DELHI - A tiger blamed for killing three people will spend the rest of its life in captivity, Indian officials said, saying the big cat was "too dangerous" to be allowed to roam free. The five-year-old male predator, also blamed for attacking cattle, had embarked on a trek more than 500 kilometres long from western Maharashtra state to central India's Betul district in Madhya Pradesh state in 2018. "We gave it several chances to re-wild but it habitually went into human habitations," Madhya Pradesh's chief wildlife warden, S.K. Mandal, told AFP.

Officials said the decision to capture the adult tiger was taken a few months ago but was delayed due to the novel coronavirus lockdown. "It will take some time for him to adjust to the new environment. We will be monitoring his behaviour," Bhopal's Van Vihar National Park director, Kamlika Mohanta, told AFP.

Human encroachment on tiger habitats have increased in recent decades in the nation of 1.3 billion people, leading to deadly conflicts with the animals. Nearly 225 people were killed in tiger attacks between 2014 and 2019, according to government figures. More than 200 tigers were killed by poachers or electrocution between 2012 and 2018, the data showed.
