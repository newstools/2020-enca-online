READ: Zimbabwe's MDC accuses police of abducting youth leaders On Thursday night, the police and army allegedly helped a rival MDC faction, led by Thokozani Khuphe and Douglas Mwonzora, to gain access to MDC headquarters. MDC Alliance leader Nelson Chamisa accused President Emmerson Mnangagwa of working with police, the courts and the army to destroy the main opposition. WATCH: Chamisa's plea to South Africa The Supreme Court recently ruled Thokozani Khuphe is the legitimate leader of the MDC. Biti and another MDC Vice President, Lynette Karenyi, were arrested as they demanded entrance to the party headquarters, which was surrounded by police. Another party official, Lovemore Chinoputsa, was dragged, screaming and shouting, into a police truck by a group of officers. The US and EU embassies also condemned the use of the police and army in the takeover of the MDC Alliance headquarters.
