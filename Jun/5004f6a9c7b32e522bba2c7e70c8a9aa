Andrew Mlangeni, the last surviving Rivonia trialist, was treated to a host of dedications from current and former presidents, ministers, friends and family via a webinar. Tributes to the character of the man poured with Minister Lindiwe Sisulu calling him her “most favourite uncle”.

President Cyril Ramaphosa says Mlangeni was full of tricks in evading security forces during apartheid and at times, his assumed identity would slip. “…and masqueraded as a man of the cloth, a reverend. Maybe you could even have become a bishop," Ramaphosa said. "At the time when you lit up a cigarette much to everyone’s shock to see a man of the cloth lighting a cigarette, then you gave yourself away.” READ: ANC veteran Andrew Mlangeni encourages youth to vote Former president Kgalema Motlanthe reminisced about the time Mlangeni found himself in front of a magistrate for traffic fines. “I remember your plea in that court. You said to the magistrate, look I spent 26-years of my life in prison. Give me any other penalty but don’t send me to prison,” he said. The birthday boy was a man of few words.
