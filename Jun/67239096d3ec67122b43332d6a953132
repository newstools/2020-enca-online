The government will soon allow restaurants to open their doors for sit-down meals, but we don't know the nitty-gritty details yet. SA lockdown: Sit-down restaurants on the brink In the meantime, one pub in Johannesburg has found a way to stay alive during these times but it has come at a massive cost. After struggling for weeks to get financial help from government and having to turn to banks for loans, Molly Malones in Joburg came up with a way of feeding its loyal customers, using a drive-in. SA lockdown: Restaurants plead with government to reopen Recently, the police shut the drive-in before the Restaurant Association's lawyers intervened. “Our country is not in a position to support the businesses that have had to close down. The police have focused on things that don’t matter. There’s a lot of crime out there, the abuse against women. The issue shouldn’t be focused on people selling burgers. It just doesn’t make sense,” said Molly Malones owner, Jenny-Lee Bot.
While the association waits to find out, what exactly government's new restaurant rules will be, Molly Malones plans on keeping the drive-in, as it feels it's a great way to keep social distancing going.
