Transport operators involved in scholar transport have also been heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as transport owner and bus driver Frans Makopo can attest. JOHANNESBURG - The transport industry has been heavily affected by the Covid-19 outbreak in South Africa, especially those who transport children to and from school. Transport owner and bus driver Frans Makopo has been out of a job since schools were shut in March. Makopo is appealing to government for support.

Grade 7 and 12 pupils have since returned to school, but once all pupils return Makopo says bus drivers will have to implement serious safety precautions.
