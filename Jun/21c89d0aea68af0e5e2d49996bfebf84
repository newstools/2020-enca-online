He believes a majority of schools will be ready. Schools were set to open for Grades 12 and 7 on Monday 1 June. The date was later postponed by one week. Teacher Unions: No PPE, No work "The external monetary and evaluation team presented recommendations which included partial reopening or delaying the reopening of schools... We do believe that a week will make a significant difference. We are of the view that come the 8th of June most certainly more than 90% of schools will be ready." The South African Democratic Teachers' Union (Sadtu) said parents shouldn't send their children to school until it's safe. The union says many schools are not ready to reopen and do not meet the safety requirements. The SA Human Rights Commission is also taking legal action against the Western Cape provincial government's decision to reopen schools on Monday, saying they are not perfectly ready to receive pupils. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
