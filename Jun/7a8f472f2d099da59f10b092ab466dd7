PARIS - A mysterious object roughly 800 light-years from Earth detected using gravitational wave sensors is either one of the smallest black holes or one of the largest neutron stars so far discovered, scientists said. The Advanced Virgo detector at the European Gravitational Observatory (EGO) in Italy and two wave observatories in the US discovered the object last year and calculated it to weigh around 2.6 times our own Sun. That places it in the Universe's "mass gap", referring to the virtually complete lack of observed objects between 2.6-5 solar masses.

The team behind the research, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, said there were several possible explanations for the object's unique nature. Chief among them is that the original object may have been a relatively small neutron star that was effectively "swallowed whole" by a black hole.

"When the masses are highly asymmetric, the smaller neutron star can be eaten in one bite."
