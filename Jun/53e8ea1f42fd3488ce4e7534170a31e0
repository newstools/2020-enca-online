Deputy National Assembly Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli threatened to remove EFF leader Julius Malema from Thursday's session. President Cyril Ramaphosa was answering questions regarding lockdown regulations when EFF MPs demanded Ramaphosa change the background of his virtual meeting. READ: EFF no longer consulting with Ramaphosa on COVID-19 A point of order was raised against Ramaphosa's venue for the meeting. The president was addressing Parliament remotely from the Union Buildings. A decision had been taken by Parliament to only display parliamentary backgrounds for meetings of the National Assembly. Tsenoli stated that since the president is not a parliamentary member, he is not required to abide by the rule. EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu also accused Ramaphosa of leading a coup d'etat against former President Jacob Zuma.
