A group of "zombies" prepare to scare people at a drive-in haunted house in Tokyo. TOKYO - A car horn beeps and the horror begins: a bloody murder and rampaging zombies. But this drive-in haunted house in Japan protects against the most terrifying enemy of all -- coronavirus. Inside a car, guests can scream as loudly as they like, with no mask required, as hideous creatures daubed in blood swarm towards them. In fact, the new format might even be scarier than a traditional haunted house, producer Kenta Iwana told AFP. "At the drive-in haunted house, guests are confined in a car so they can't escape the horror until the end," he said.

Iwana came up with the drive-in solution after struggling with a string of cancellations as the coronavirus outbreak took hold. "It's because a haunted house creates an environment with three Cs," he said, referring to the conditions Japanese experts warn risk spreading the virus: closed spaces, crowded places and close-contact settings. "Orders for conventional-style haunted houses were cancelled one after another and we lost about 80 percent of our clients."

Japan's coronavirus state of emergency has already been lifted, and some amusement parks are slowly beginning to reopen, with restrictions on guests. But the squad is moving ahead with its drive-in concept for now, and tickets for its first dates next month at a Tokyo garage have already sold out.
