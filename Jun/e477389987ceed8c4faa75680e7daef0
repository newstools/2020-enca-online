Harold Varner lines up a putt on the fifth green during the second round of the Charles Schwab Challenge. LOS ANGELES - Harold Varner overcame a triple-bogey start to maintain the lead at the halfway stage of the Charles Schwab Challenge on Friday as the hard-charging Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth appear poised to strike. Varner fired a four-under-par 66 at Colonial Country Club to reach 11-under 129 after 36 holes in the US PGA Tour's return event after a three-month shutdown due to the new coronavirus pandemic. Jordan Spieth and Bryson DeChambeau are tied for second, one stroke back after a second consecutive 65s, while world number one McIlroy fired a 63 to join Collin Morikawa and Xander Schauffele sharing third on 131. READ: US PGA Tour plans to resume in June without fans England's Justin Rose and American Justin Thomas are tied for seventh. This week's Charles Schwab Challenge is full of firsts, the biggest change being the absence of spectators. Players have to undergo temperature screenings, regular COVID-19 testing and practice social distancing. The field includes 15 of the world's top 20 players, but some bigger names from outside of North America skipped it because travelling to the US would mean two-weeks quarantine.

Varner bounced back with birdies from four feet at 11 and 10 feet at the par-three 12th and par-three 16th holes. "If you going to make a triple do it while you are playing well," said Varner, seeking his first PGA Tour win. "I got it back in a hurry, so that was nice... The way I finished was pretty awesome."
