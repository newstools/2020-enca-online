"The minister knows what is at hand. The minster knows what the grievances of the industry are..." said Santaco spokesperson, Thabiso Molelekwa. The taxi industry has rejected government's relief fund of over R1-billion. They claim the relief fund is not enough to keep some owners afloat. WATCH: Thousands of commuters stranded in Gauteng Taxis are only allowed to run at 70 percent loading capacity. The associations say this has crippled the industry. The transport department hopes to reach an agreement with the associations. Taxi owners say government's offer of over R1-billion is not enough to offset their losses due to COVID-19. They say this will not be sufficient to keep some owners afloat. Earlier this week, Gauteng associations embarked on a shutdown to raise their concerns.
