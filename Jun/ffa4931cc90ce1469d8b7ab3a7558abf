Torien Pienaar (23) is one of the six prisoners who ate food that was laced with poison. It's understood one of the inmates was paid a visit this week and given food. He shared it with others, not knowing it was laced with poison. READ: Innocent man considers legal action after 16 years in prison Two prisoners are in ICU and two have been discharged from hospital.
