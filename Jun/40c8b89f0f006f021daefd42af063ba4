Genichi Mitsuhashi has become the first student ever to graduate from a Japanese university with a master's degree in ninja studies. TOKYO - Japan has produced its first ninja studies graduate after Genichi Mitsuhashi spent two years honing his martial arts skills and absorbing the finer traditions of the feudal martial arts agents. The 45-year-old completed the master's course at Mie University in central Japan, the region considered the home of the ninja. In addition to researching historical documents, Mitsuhashi told AFP he took the practical aspect of being a ninja to heart. "I read that ninjas worked as farmers in the morning and trained in martial arts in the afternoon," he said.
