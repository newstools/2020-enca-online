File: The WHO launched the trial in March. JOHANNESBURG - The South African arm of the World Health Organisation’s Solidarity Trial has been given the green light. The first patients are expected to be enrolled this week. The WHO launched the trial in March. Its goal is to identify an effective treatment for COVID-19 using existing treatments for other illnesses. The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority and the Wits University Ethics Committee have approved it. The team is now waiting for the delivery of an anti-retroviral drug - expected next week - before the first patients can be treated. The Helen Joseph and Chris Hani Baragwanath hospitals are expected to be the first to start because they have all the hospital-level approvals already in place.
