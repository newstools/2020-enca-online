Anton Harman and his family. - My father, Anton John Harman a.k.a Fred by his friends passed away due to COVID-19 on 21 May 2020. He tested positive on 14 April 2020. Anton Harman was admitted to hospital on 22 April and was put on a ventilator. He stayed on the ventilator for 29 days before he passed away. He was only 54 years old. He was many things to many people. He was a man who put 110% in everything he did. He was an operational specialist/trainer for SARS. He was married for 28 years to my mother, Tracy Harman, and a father for 22 years. He was more than my father he was a friend to joke around with and have tons of fun. He was also my study partner. In 2017 we both decided to study for our LLB degrees through UNISA. This virus took him from everyone that loved him too soon. The photo was taken on 31 December 2019 at the Elangeni hotel of the three of us as a family. -  Submitted by Thea Harman
