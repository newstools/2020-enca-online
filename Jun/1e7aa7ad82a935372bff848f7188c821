Canterbury Crusaders captain Scott Barrett will have to undergo toe surgery. WELLINGTON - Canterbury Crusaders captain Scott Barrett has been ruled out of the rest of New Zealand's domestic Super Rugby season with a toe injury that requires surgery, the team said on Wednesday. The All Blacks lock suffered a "significant injury to the structures supporting his big toe" in a training game earlier this month, the Crusaders said.

All Blacks hooker Codie Taylor will take over as Crusaders captain, while Alex Ainley has joined the squad as injury cover. The Crusaders are the dominant side in Super Rugby, winning the last three editions, and they beat the Wellington Hurricanes 39-25 in their Super Rugby Aotearoa debut last week.
