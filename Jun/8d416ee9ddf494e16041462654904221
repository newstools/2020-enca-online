After 100 years of innovation, Wahl continues to adapt and improve products along with advances in technology and consumer needs. SPONSORED: Wahl Clipper Corporation recently celebrated 100 years of innovation, growth, and of course great haircuts. We all know there’s nothing worse than a bad haircut. In 1919 Leo J Wahl, a young entrepreneur, frequented barber shops selling his massager powered by an electromagnetic motor. He intuitively noticed that the tools barbers were using lacked in performance and usability. Leo knew he could do it better, which he did. Barbers were once known for far more than just haircuts. Whether a man needed a haircut, beard trim, a tooth pulled, or even life advice, the local barber had you covered. On top of having a lengthy resume, barbers determined a man’s appearance and, in turn, his confidence. As hairstyles continued to evolve into fashion, barbers, stylists, and Wahl Clippers did too. Leo worked closely with barbers and was quick to apply their feedback to his evolving product line. By the 1990’s, Wahl had already established offices in Germany, Hungary, China, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Great haircuts were happening across the globe, but Wahl didn’t stop there. After 100 years of innovation, Wahl continues to adapt and improve products along with advances in technology and consumer needs. To date, Wahl has sold millions of hair clippers worldwide. Still family-owned (fourth generation) and operated in hometown Sterling, Illinois USA. Wahl products may change, but the commitment to integrity, value and efficiency will always remain constant. Wahl manufactures on four continents, and exports to 165 different countries as the world leader in clipping and grooming tools. The Wahl brand has been proudly established in South Africa for over 35 years. We look forward to celebrating and styling YOU into the next century.
