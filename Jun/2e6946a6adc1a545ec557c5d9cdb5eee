The total number of confirmed positive COVID-19 cases in South Africa stands at 97,302 with 1,930 deaths. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Health Minister Zweli Mkhize says the drug dexamethasone has a very limited, but helpful effect on patients. He says according to estimates about 42 percent of patients on ventilators have succumbed to the coronavirus. Mkhize says it's hoped that the steroid will reduce this number. Mkhize: SA has capacity to provide dexamethasone to COVID-19 patients “It reduces the number of people who die, it doesn't necessarily stop anyone from succumbing to COVID-19. The second aspect is that it has no effect on people who have got milder symptoms. However, our biggest concern I that it is associated with comorbidities..." said Mkhize. Meanwhile, Mkhize says some COVID-19 patients in the Western Cape have refused to go into isolation or quarantine. He says this is a major concern. The province has over 51,000 infections. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday.
