Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Africa is over 100,000 with deaths numbering almost 2,300. Over 6,500 new cases of COVID-19 were reported in the last 24 hours. The rapid increase of confirmed infections begs the question of whether South Africans are adhering to safety regulations, and if we are prepared for the consequences.

"That's really unfortunate because this is something that certainly was under our control, both in Gauteng as well as the Western Cape and the rest of the country. "The poor adherence when it comes to the non-pharmaceutical interventions, independent of whether someone is at risk of developing severe COVID or not -- we need to understand that even if people are not at risk for developing severe disease because they're otherwise healthy; they are very responsible for the spread this virus," he said. - Coronavirus Hotline Number: 0800 029 999 from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday Help protect your loved ones by sharing this official South African government COVID-19 service with your family, friends and community.
