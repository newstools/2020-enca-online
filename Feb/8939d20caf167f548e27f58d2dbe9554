"The Mandalorian" follows a mysterious bounty hunter who roams the galaxy's lawless outer reaches looking for mercenary work. LOS ANGELES - Disney is ramping up its Baby Yoda content with the next series of "The Mandalorian" set for October and potential spinoffs in the works, chief Bob Iger said. The live-action "Star Wars" television show launched last year was a hit for new streaming platform Disney+, with its tiny, cute co-star taking "the world by storm," said Iger. Setting an October launch for season two on an earnings call, Iger promised "more coming from 'The Mandalorian' thereafter, including the possibility of infusing it with more characters." This could include "taking those characters in their own direction in terms of series," he said.

"The Mandalorian" follows a mysterious bounty hunter played by Pedro Pascal ("Game of Thrones") who roams the galaxy's lawless outer reaches looking for mercenary work. During the first season, he formed an unlikely bond with a small, adorable creature officially called "The Child," but dubbed Baby Yoda by online fans. The mischievous, green tyke launched thousands of memes, knocking Democratic presidential candidates off the top of news searches.
