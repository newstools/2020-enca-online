Harvey Weinstein (67) was convicted of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006 and raping Jessica Mann in 2013. NEW YORK - Former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was convicted of sexual assault by a New York jury on Monday but acquitted on the most serious charges that could have sent him to prison for the rest of his life. Once one of Hollywood's most powerful producers, Weinstein (67) was convicted of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006 and raping Jessica Mann, a onetime aspiring actress, in 2013. He faces up to 25 years in prison. READ: Weinstein jury to begin deliberations He was acquitted on the most serious charge, predatory sexual assault, which carried a potential life sentence. The case was a milestone for the #MeToo movement that inspired women to go public with misconduct allegations against powerful men. During his trial, Weinstein often appeared feeble, entering the courthouse using a walker. He sometimes leaned on his lead attorney, Donna Rotunno, for support. Weinstein made his mark with critically acclaimed films such as "The English Patient" and "Shakespeare in Love." READ: Rape trial told Weinstein a 'seasoned' predator More than 80 women, including famous actresses, had accused him of sexual misconduct stretching back decades. He had denied the allegations and said any sexual encounters were consensual. During the trial, prosecutors portrayed Weinstein as a serial predator who had manipulated women with promises to open doors in Hollywood, coaxing them to hotel rooms or private apartments and then overpowering and violently attacking them. "The man seated right there was not just a titan in Hollywood, he was a rapist," Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Meghan Hast said during opening arguments. Weinstein still faces sexual assault charges in California, which were announced just hours after his New York rape trial began, and dozens of women have filed civil lawsuits against him.
