JOHANNESBURG - A Johannesburg couple, who started a culinary school eight years ago, are changing the lives of children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Kelvin Joel was the first black pastry chef at a popular Sandton hotel. After hitting a glass ceiling in his career, he felt the need to do more for people of colour in the food industry. After cashing in his pension, he started a culinary school with his wife Jarlyne with the aim to get children from poor communities on a successful career path. The school boasts a culinary learning ground and three internationally recognised courses that are 40% cheaper than mainstream schools. Students gain a wealth of practical experience but are taught to think entrepreneurially too.
 
The school has had more than 600 graduates, some of whom are travelling the world and this has inspired others.
