South Africa’s newly adopted refugee's amendment act has been slammed for failing to protect refugees. The act introduced in the name of national security strips asylum seekers of their rights to engage in political activity while also limiting their job choices.

Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi says to be cautious, the patient has been isolated. Botswana has recorded five suspected coronavirus cases. Coronavirus: SANDF medical staff deployed to ports of entry “I've liaisoned to the MEC for Health in Limpopo, Dr Phophi Ramathuba...She said they were taking precautions. The person has flu but simply because she works at Botswana border post they wanted to err on the side of caution and they've isolated him just for that...They don't think he's got the virus...” Motsoaledi said. The death toll in China has risen to 490. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
