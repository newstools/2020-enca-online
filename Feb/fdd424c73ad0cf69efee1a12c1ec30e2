MASERU - Pressure mounted on Lesotho Prime Minister Thomas Thabane to step down after he appeared in court over the murder of his estranged wife. The latest twist in a saga that has gripped the southern African kingdom came after a weekend in which the 80-year-old was said to be receiving emergency medical care in South Africa. The case has increased pressure on Thabane to step down.

"We have asked the PM to step down while on the other hand we have submitted (to a party parliamentary caucus) the name of Mr Sam Rapapa to succeed him," party's spokesman Montoeli Masoetsa told AFP. On the streets of Maseru, the people of Lesotho also want him gone from office.

The magistrate's court in Maseru had been expected to formally read out charges against Thabane for allegedly acting in "common purpose" in the June 2017 killing of 58-year old Lipolelo Thabane, whom he was in the process of divorcing. But after a brief sitting, the matter was deferred to the High Court and the prime minister was not formally charged.

She has already been charged with murder and is out on bail.
