JOHANNESBURG - Nedbank and Old Mutual, in partnership with eNCA held a panel discussion, as the country face economic challenges. This follows Finance Minister Tito Mboweni's budget speech on Wednesday. Credit Ratings Agency Fitch has been scathing in its response to the budget speech. It says government is not doing enough to fix its debt problems. The agency described Mboweni’s budget as a reflection of the severe deterioration of public finances. South Africa's economy is expected to grow by less than one-percent this year and 1.3-percent in 2021.
