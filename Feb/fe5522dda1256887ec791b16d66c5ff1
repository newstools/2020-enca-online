Load-shedding is likely to continue for the next 18-months as the utility implements critical maintenance. READ: Eskom will suspend load-shedding overnight “Improve the efficiency of the plant, ensure that when maintenance is done it lasts. Ministers don’t interfere we check the micro details to underway whether the fix is actually the fix so we now have data that shows that contracts that show they do a half-baked job. That’s the focus of the CEO and the board now is to fix the operations. Review coal and IPP contracts. If you do that properly for the next three to four months, we'll be saving a lot of money for the state.” President Cyril Ramaphosa was candid about the power crises in his SONA speech admitting the debilitating effect it has on the economic life of SA. He promised that the state will fix Eskom. However he said very little about struggling state owned entities such as SAA, SA Express , Denel and Prasa among others.
