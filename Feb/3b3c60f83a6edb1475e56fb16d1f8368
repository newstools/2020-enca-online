LOS ANGELES - Wreckage at the scene of the helicopter crash that killed NBA great Kobe Bryant and eight others showed no evidence of engine failure, a preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said. Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna were among the nine who perished when the helicopter crashed in rugged terrain west of Los Angeles on 26 January. "All significant components of the helicopter were located within the wreckage area," according to the report. "Examination of the main and tail rotor assemblies found damage consistent with powered rotation at the time of impact.
