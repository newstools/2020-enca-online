JOHANNESBURG - DA Head of Policy, Gwen Ngwenya, has qualified her comment that it was a privilege to meet former President FW de Klerk. "I did not praise him. I said it was a privilege to have been able to spend a day and talk to him," she said. "If I had the opportunity to spend a day with someone and get first-hand insights into history and to ask him for example, did he have any doubts the day he announced Mandela's release or was there absolute conviction at that point?... not many people have the opportunity to ask someone what were his thoughts in key moments in history," Ngwenya said. Ngwenya was speaking during the party's release of the first of three policy discussion documents, in preparation for its policy congress in April. It's been a tough time for the DA, with the exit of Mmusi Maimane and other leaders.
