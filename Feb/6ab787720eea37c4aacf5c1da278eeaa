The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse and the South African Airways Pilots Association want the court to declare her a delinquent director. PRETORIA - Former SAA Board Chairperson, Dudu Myeni said she has been made a scapegoat regarding the Emirate's airline deal. WATCH: Myeni testifies in delinquency case Myeni said neither she nor former President Jacob Zuma blocked the deal but rather that it was a collective decision by the board. Previous witnesses claim the airline lost R1,5-billion by not signing the deal. Myeni said, "every other blame was Dudu or Zuma, I never had a voice, I still don't have a voice, therefore, this was my voice to say let's conclude this..." "I applied my mind, exercised the duty care, and skill that's why today I'm an expert at governance because I know that you don't just see something that is presented to you, put a stamp and say approved... It's not true, my Lady that the Emirates deal was blocked by Dudu, it's not true that SAA lost money and billions of rand because we didn't approve this." Myeni has also denied allegations that she was appointed by former president Jacob Zuma.
