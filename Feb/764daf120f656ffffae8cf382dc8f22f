The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) says it will fight a decision by SAA's business rescue practitioners to cut jobs. #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Numsa and the South African Cabin Crew Association (Sacca)  warn they could stop SAA's Business Rescue Practitioners from submitting their business rescue plan if union members are not consulted as part of the process. The unions want all stakeholders and their members to be consulted during the business rescue process.
