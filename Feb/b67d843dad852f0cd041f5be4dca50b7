JOHANNESBURG - Klipspruit residents in Soweto have vowed to continue their protest against the local ward councillor. They say she's failed to make good on infrastructure promises and want her gone. Residents in Ward 37 in Soweto have been demonstrating against their councillor, Zodwa Nxumalo, who they say has failed them when it comes to service delivery. They say in the four terms she's served as a councillor, they've seen no progress and want her to resign. A representative for the mayor has accepted a memorandum and has been given seven days to attend to the matter. In the meantime, the community has vowed to continue protesting.
