CAPE TOWN - After a long delay, the verification process of refugees in Cape Town finally got underway. READ: City of Cape Town wins case against refugees Officials had to wait until each of the refugees had been served with a copy of this week's court order. The court ruled in favour of the city, paving the way to remove the hundreds of refugees who've been living near the Central Methodist Church on Greenmarket Square. One of the refugee leaders said the ruling exposes South Africa's attitude towards refugees. The more than 700 refugees have been living there since October last year -- impacting local businesses -- while they demand to be resettled to other countries. "I'm so happy and very glad about what happened. The whole world will witness what South Africa is all about towards refugees," said refugee leader Jean-Pierre Balous. "As a refugee in South Africa you don't have any rights, you don't have anything. They treat you like a second-class citizen, they treat you like nothing."
