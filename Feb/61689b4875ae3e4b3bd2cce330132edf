File: Lesotho police allege Maesaiah Thabane (pictured) hired eight assassins to kill her husband Thomas Thabane's former wife Lipolelo Thabane. JOHANNESBURG - Lesotho's Prime Minister Thomas Thabane has made an appearance in a Lesotho court on Monday. READ: Lesotho PM to be charged with murdering wife Thabane and his current wife are accused of being involved in the murder of his first wife. He was scheduled to appear in court on Friday but was a no show. Lesotho police on Saturday said they would wait for the prime minister's return from "sick leave" to resume the court case. Thabane, 80, had been due in court for a preliminary appearance on Friday, where he was expected to be formally charged. Lipolelo Thabane's murder sent shock waves through Lesotho - a tiny landlocked nation of 2.2-million that has a long history of political turmoil. She was gunned down outside her home in the capital Maseru just two days before her husband took office. - Additional reporting AFP -
