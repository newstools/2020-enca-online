The Razzies unveiled their annual list of the year's most dreadful movies, with the critically slated musical "Cats" at the top of the charts. LOS ANGELES - It's the one award no Hollywood star wants to win. The Razzies unveiled their annual list of the year's most dreadful movies, with the critically slated musical "Cats" at the top -- or arguably rock bottom -- of the charts. Among its nine unwanted nominations, "Cats" landed acting nods for Judi Dench, James Corden, and Rebel Wilson. The film -- an adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical -- used computer-generated effects to morph its all-star cast into deeply unnerving half-human, half-cat hybrids. It received stunningly bad reviews. The Guardian called it a "dreadful hairball of woe," while for the Wall Street Journal it was "a confusing litter box of intentions".

Also racking up the nominations were Sylvester Stallone's disastrous latest "Rambo" sequel, and "The Fanatic," a not-so-thrilling thriller starring John Travolta and directed by former Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst. Formally known as the Golden Raspberry Awards, the Razzies are usually handed out the day before the Oscars, serving to mock the following night's self-congratulatory Tinseltown pageantry.
