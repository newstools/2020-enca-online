JOHANNESBURG - eNCA has reliably learned that the former driver of Ace Magashule will appear in the dock next month in connection with the disappearance of a Pierneef painting. The painting in question is worth millions and was part of the office furniture whilst Magashule was the premier of the Free State. The NPA is not prepared to comment on the matter on camera, but the Hawks have confirmed that they handed the matter over to the NPA last year. The painting, by famous landscape artist Jacobus Pierneef, is valued at approximately R8-million. The disappearance of the painting, first reported on by the Daily Maverick, happened in March 2018.
