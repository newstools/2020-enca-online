READ: Cape Town Uber, Bolt drivers urged to avoid hijack hotspots The drivers say the ride-hailing companies take most of their earnings. They're also concerned about their safety, saying they're being robbed and hijacked. The drivers have submitted a memorandum of demands to their employers and have given them until Tuesday to respond. One driver shared, "we are getting assaulted in our association by taxi association patrol because we are an - hailing company who have nothing to prove." "How are they letting us pay more than R1000 a driver per week? It's for affiliation, and they don't even compensate us. Our drivers are getting robbed and assaulted. There are hotspots where killings and hijacks are possible. We lost more phones there but cases are not being opened."
Oscar Mukhari, an owner and driver said, "we are concerned about the safety of our drivers. Someone can buy a SIM card from a spaza shop and access the app and then call the car when the car gets there they attack the driver and take everything. At the end of the day, it's our cars. We pay the instalments for the car. They are having a commission of 27% and I don't get anything."
