According to School Governing Body member Mary Nkwanyana in rainy weather, sewage in the corridors rises and seeps into classrooms. "We can't have this situation. How will they learn when there's a foul smell? They are even scared to step inside the classroom and they don't have a place to play anymore. The sewage is also close to the kitchen where food is prepared for the children." READ: Schoolgirl accused of bullying appears in court Parents say they've had enough.
