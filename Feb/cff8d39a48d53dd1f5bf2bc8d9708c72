Former Australian tennis player Margaret Court poses with a replica of the trophy to commemorate 50 years of her Australian grand slam win. MELBOURNE - Margaret Court has criticised Tennis Australia (TA) following her awkward appearance at the Australian Open last week, saying the governing body had "discriminated" against her due to her opposition to gay marriage. Tennis Australia (TA) invited Court, who won a record 24 Grand Slam titles, to Melbourne Park to recognise the 50th anniversary of her 1970 calendar Grand Slam, while saying it disagreed with her "personal views". "From the tennis side they've pointed the finger at me and tried to discriminate in everything that I've done and I think that's very sad," the 77-year-old told local broadcaster Nine Network. "I think they think because I'm a preacher, they think I'm going to preach the gospel."

"We are very disappointed to hear now of her complaints, none of which were expressed to us during her time at the Australian Open," TA said in a statement. Court also slammed former players Martina Navratilova and John McEnroe for calling for a name-change for the Australian Open's second showcourt "Margaret Court Arena" at the stadium last week. "I'd never go to another nation, whatever I thought of a person, I would never say, 'hey, you should take their name off a building or off an arena, or a tennis centre," Court said. "I think that was very, very wrong."
