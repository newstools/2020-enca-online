R3-billion has been spent on the project since 2013, but not a single bus is running yet. DURBAN - Yet another hiccup has hit the Go!Durban project which is supposed to provide flexible, safe and cost-effective transport to the city's people. R3-billion has been spent on the project since 2013, but not a single bus is running yet. The eThekwini Municipality has had to return R309-million in unspent money. It says it will reapply for the funds, but it's not clear whether Treasury can release this again.

"We have faced quite a number of challenges which have resulted in work stoppages to the tune of about eight months and as a result, we couldn't spend that amount of money as we wished," said municipal spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela.
The city says ongoing disputes with third parties have caused delays.
The municipality insists it's on track to launch the next phase of Go Durban by June this year, but it's not clear when the first bus will actually hit the road.
