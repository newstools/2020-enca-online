It seems former president FW de Klerk and his foundation are not aware that apartheid was a crime against humanity.

The Economic Freedom Fighters called for De Klerk's removal during last week's State of the Nation Address. The former president and his foundation deny that apartheid was a crime against humanity despite a declaration by the United Nations in 1973. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe says that there is no way that the party cannot be seen to be taking action. "It is important that when reflections are made by those that have been deployed in parliament to take strong actions that suggest if there is this kind of denialism there is no way that they can be associated with those that deny that there ha been a groundswell attack on the integrity and standing on our people on a system called apartheid. "In the statement that we issued, we reflected on a number of people that may have been killed as a result of apartheid." WATCH: FW de Klerk on land reform, economy and apartheid Parliament is defending its decision to invite De Klerk. Deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli has described last week's incident as a deflection. "As Parliament, we do not get into debates on people's views are during this period," said Tsenoli. "We do not give diplomatic immunity to those we invite if they say wrong things or whatever things they say, for us it’s not in the interest of parliament to then change our minds," Tsenoli added. The debate about former President FW de Klerk's presence at the State of the Nation Address is not dying down. This is after he stated that apartheid wasn't a crime against humanity. The EFF disrupted the address and wanted the former National Party leader removed. Courtesy #DStv403
