Military officers escort the coffin of late former Kenya's President Daniel Arap Moi into Parliament Buildings for public viewing. NAIROBI - Former Kenyan president Daniel Arap Moi, who ruled the country with an iron fist between 1978 and 2002, will be honoured with a state funeral on 11 February, the government said. Moi died on 4 February aged 95. Moi's body will lie in state for public viewing from Saturday until Monday, before a memorial service on Tuesday in the Nyayo national stadium in the capital Nairobi, officials said.

Tuesday has been declared a national holiday. "We encourage each and every Kenyan to plant a tree in his memory," Kinyua said. His body will be buried the next day in his home area of Kabarak, 220 kilometres northwest of Nairobi. Moi's 24-year rule saw his country become a one-party state where critical voices were crushed, corruption became endemic and tribal divisions were stoked and turned bloody. Moi was however praised for keeping Kenya a relative haven of peace during a chaotic period in east Africa.
