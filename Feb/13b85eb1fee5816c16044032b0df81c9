Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Nelson Mandela's incarceration meant he never got to see his grandchildren grow up. His eldest grandson Mandla was born while Mandela was in jail. Mandela, the chief of Mvezo, says there's much that the new generation can learn from the country's struggle heroes. WATCH: 30 years since Mandela's release from prison He first met his grandfather as a nine-year-old in 1983 - a decision taken by his late father, Makgatho. “Growing up in Soweto I would hear people shouting viva Mandela, viva. And it was very profound to me, there I was a young kid holding this surname and I didn't know what it meant. I slotted myself in. They would say Amandla, one name Mandla, another name Mandela, I thought I was very important.” eNCA's Lindsay Dentlinger spoke to him.
