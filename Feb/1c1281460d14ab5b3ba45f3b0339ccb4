"To support growth, we propose no major tax increases," Mboweni said. "Indeed, there is some real personal income tax relief. This budget means that a teacher who earns on average R460 000 a year, will see their taxes reduced by nearly R3,400 a year. Hard-working taxpayers, who earn on average R265 000 a year, will see their income tax reduced by over R1,500 a year. "Our income tax system is progressive, and the adjustments reflect this. Someone earning R10 000 a month will pay 10-percent less in tax. Someone earning R100 000 a month will pay about 1.5-percent less. We are also proposing broadening the corporate income tax base. This additional revenue will be used to reduce the corporate tax rate in the near future to help our businesses grow."
