Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Former intelligence chief Mo Shaik has refuted the Democratic Alliance's claim that was set to pocket R1.9-million per year working for the Department of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation. Shaik has resigned from his position as a special advisor to Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu. He is said to be eying a position as a member of the advisory committee on the stabilisation of the water sector. Shaik says he’s better suited to the position because of his experience in investment and infrastructure. READ: Mo Shaik: Zuma misused his powers The DA says Shaik’s appointment as a special advisor and subsequent re-appointment onto a tax-payer funded advisory committee of the department, earning R7,000 per day for a maximum of 15 days per month is the very definition of cadre deployment. However, Shaik has hit back and accused the DA of distorting figures. "I am on a part-time basis, so I cannot work more than 15 days per month for the department and we are paid R7,000 per day of work for those 15 days," Shaik said. "How do they compute that to R1.9-million baffles me and it just speaks to the qualifications of the DA to do basic accounting in my view."
