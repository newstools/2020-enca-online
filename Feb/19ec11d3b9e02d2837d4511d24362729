File: Eskom is battling to keep the lights on. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom suspended stage two load-shedding on Sunday night and will implement stage one on Monday at 9am. The parastatal is urging South Africans to use electricity sparingly. READ: Eskom and economy a priority: Ramaphosa Eskom warns that any additional shifts in demand may force a change in the load-shedding stage. "Eskom also wishes to remind South Africans that there is an increased possibility of loadshedding over the next 18 months as we are conducting critical maintenance to restore the ageing plant to good health," Eskom said in a statement. "While dam levels have recovered adequately enough to allow for a reduction to Stage 1 loadshedding, there is still some work being done to improve diesel stocks."
