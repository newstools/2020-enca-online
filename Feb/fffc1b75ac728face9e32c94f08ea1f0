The first team to reach the cumulative target score will win the NBA All-Star Game. All-Star Game jerseys will also honor Bryant and his daughter. Team Giannis players will wear jersey number 24 in tribute to Kobe while Team LeBron players will wear jersey number two, the number his daughter wore when playing youth basketball. Both teams will wear jersey patches displaying nine stars, representing the nine people who were killed in the crash. Academy Award-winning actress and Grammy Award-winning singer Jennifer Hudson, a Chicago native, will perform a special tribute to Bryant, his daughter and the others who were killed in the crash. Her performance will begin the night ahead of the player introductions.
