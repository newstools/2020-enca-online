Gcaleka said, "what I saw here today is a passionate team, enthusiastic about their work. Everything else is a side issue. The real work of this office will not be hindered."
"It is for this office to hold steadfast, focus on the job, and let the Public Protector as the head to handle other matters. The work has to continue because the people of South Africa are looking up to this office to realise their hopes," she said.
Mkwhebane is looking up to the courts, to realise her hopes of staying in the job. Mkhwebane's lawyers spent the day putting the final touches to her court papers, challenging the legality of the impending investigation into her fitness to hold office.
