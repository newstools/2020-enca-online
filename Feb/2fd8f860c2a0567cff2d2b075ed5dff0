eNCA's Heidi Giokos attended the first summit in Soweto. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng's Community Safety MEC, Faith Mazibuko is holding Safety Summits, to speak to the communities that face gangsterism, drugs and violence every day. The MEC says they're not just more talk shops as the community of Braamfischerville in Soweto is crying out for help, needing more hands-on deck. Drugs, youth unemployment, not enough policing on the ground, densely populated areas. These are just some of the many red flags they've raised. The people of Braamfischerville are being encouraged to come forward with any information that may help. They've been urged to be the police's ears and eyes to make their community safe again.
