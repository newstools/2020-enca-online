An ambassador for anti-bullying organisation BraveHeart, Chad Esau plans to use the platform to reach out to people who've also experienced bullying. CAPE TOWN - Some say he's bashing yet another traditional beauty norm, but Chad Esau hopes he can be a beacon of hope for other reasons. The 21-year-old from Cape Town lives with the skin condition known as vitiligo. But he's not letting that hold him back. He's hoping to be crowned the next Mr South Africa. Esau admits it's taken him a long time to embrace the fact that he was different.

It was on a graveyard shift that a modelling agent turned his world upside down. Esau is now in the running for the 2020 Mr South Africa title. An ambassador for anti-bullying organisation BraveHeart, he plans to use the platform to reach out to people who've also experienced bullying. He says he believes South Africa needs a comprehensive programme to help children and adults deal with this scourge.
