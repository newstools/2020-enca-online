CAPE TOWN - Ex-ministers and supporters of former president Jacob Zuma say they're being politically persecuted for their perceived role in state capture. The so-called Radical Economic Transformation group has turned up at the Cape Town Magistrate's Court to support MP, Bongani Bongo. READ:Â Bongo corruption case moved to High Court Bongo is facing a charge of corruption in relation to Parliament's Eskom inquiry.
It's alleged he attempted to bribe the evidence leader of Parliament's Eskom inquiry to quash the proceedings but his supporters say they are being unfairly linked to state capture.
ANC MP Mosebenzi Zwane said, "some of us are given a raw deal in this country. I believe some of us are treated worse than De Klerk. There is an agenda to remove us from the progressive movement of the ANC, and persecute us without us having a fair say in this persecution."
Zwane also took a swipe at comments made by Justice Minister Ronald Lamola.
He said, "so if the view is that anybody who believes in RET is a thug, and they must be jailed, put in orange overalls, it sends a wrong message."
The group says it will welcome home former president Jacob Zuma on Saturday, who has been reportedly receiving medical treatment abroad.
Bongo's case has now been transferred to the Western Cape Division of the High Court where he will have to appear for a pre-trial hearing in April.
