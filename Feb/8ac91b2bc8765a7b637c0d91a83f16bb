"Prasa was not aware of Eskom's action as the rail passenger agency was in constant contact with the power utility regarding the account," Prasa said. "Eskom wants Prasa to pay within 14 days of receiving an invoice, which is currently practically impossible. This point has been raised with Eskom and Prasa will reiterate it as we engage with them further." However, on Thursday evening Eskom said it had received of proof payment bringing Prasa's account to current. Limited train service was restored with full service expected on Friday morning.
