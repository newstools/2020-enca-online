CAPE TOWN - Parliament was again the scene of chaotic scenes on Tuesday during the debate on the State of the Nation Address. EFF leader Julius Malema was thrown out of the chamber after accusing President Cyril Ramaphosa of gender-based violence. Opposition parties say it’s time to tighten the rules to stop the House from being brought into disrepute. Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu slammed the EFF's disruptions at last week's Sona during his time to address the House. It wasn’t long before the situation denigrated again.

DA MP Natasha Mazzone rose to draw attention to the use of gender-based violence as a political ploy.

"If anyone in this country thinks that what just happend in this House is aceptable, they certainly need their heads read. "We as Parliament need to now stand together and say: Enough is enough."
