While people are desperate for jobs, scammers see this as an opportunity. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Stats SA announced that unemployment in the country remains unchanged at a staggering 29.1 percent. While people are desperate for jobs, scammers see this as an opportunity. As the saying goes, desperate times call for desperate measures. Many people are even willing to pay to secure a job interview - but they are often scammed. This happened to Lucas Mmalefahlo from Soshanguve in Pretoria. "I called to inquire about the job and found someone called Mr Mokoena, he told me the job was legit and that I should come to the CBD. He told me that if I want the job, and without any interviews, they are going to want something. I asked how much they wanted, because I am not working, they said R500. I then borrowed the money from my friend." Mmalefahlo sent the bogus recruiter two R250 airtime vouchers. "When I called, trying the number again, the number wasn't going through, and my emails were bouncing. That's when I realized that it's a scam." Mmalefahlo says he has learnt this lesson the hard way. Unfortunately, he's just one of many unemployed people who continue to fall victim to job scams - because they're so desperate.
