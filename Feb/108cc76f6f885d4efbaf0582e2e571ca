Police at OR Tambo airport have confiscated what they believe to be 21kg of cocaine.  JOHANNESBURG - Three passengers have been arrested at OR Tambo International Airport in a suspected R26-million cocaine bust. Police spokesperson Brigadier Vish Naidoo said a Brakpan man destined for Hong Kong was arrested on Saturday morning. The other two suspects -- a man and a woman -- arrived in the country from South America. "Drug traffickers and smugglers should know the joint security forces at the airport are not resting," said Naidoo. "We will constantly be looking out for drugs." Naidoo said intelligence work and information gathered by operatives is what's helping police to easily detect and identify those that are trying to smuggle drugs in and out of the country.
