In the past, candidates had to register on the department's database, which has been prone to manipulation.
KZN Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu explained the benefits of the app. "You even select the district which you are prepared to go work at should there be any vacant post." WATCH: Teaching not first choice for teachers School principals also seem to be on board.
Neil van Jaarsveld, Port Natal School principal said, "I think it's a great initiative from the department to make sure that we can have a quicker turnaround time. That's a big problem where you sit without staff members or pupil in the class because of the time it uses."
The app is available on various platforms under the name KZN Qualified Educators.
