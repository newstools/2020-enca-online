Gauteng department of education's Steve Mabona says the suspect was arrested and is being held at a correctional service centre for minors. He says they've sent a team to help pupils deal with the trauma. According to Mabona the two pupils involved in the incident were from different schools. "Information indicates that there was an argument between the two next to certain houses in the township and subsequently the girl learner stabbed the boy learner who tried to run away. Unfortunately, it was too late." The boy learner was confirmed dead on the scene by police and emergency services. Watch the full interview with Gauteng department of education's Steve Mabona above.
