JOHANNESBURG - On Monday, former SAA interim CEO and current Mango CEO Nico Bezuidenhout continued his testimony into whether or not former SAA Chairperson Dudu Myeni should be declared a delinquent director. WATCH: Mounting misfortune worsens at SAA Bezuidenhout last week detailed how Myeni was directly involved in procurement processes at the embattled SOE and was integral to the cancellation of a contract with Emirates that would’ve seen R1-billion injected into the airline.
