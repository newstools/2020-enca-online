US actor Joaquin Phoenix poses on the red carpet upon arrival at the BAFTA British Academy Film Awards at the Royal Albert Hall in London on February 2, 2020. JOHANNESBURG - American actor and producer Joaquin Phoenix on Sunday called out the film industry's diversity problem during his acceptance speech for Best Actor at the BAFTA Awards. The BAFTAs caused outrage on social media for the lack of diversity in its nominees this year. The Joker actor said although it was an "honour" to win, it was time for award shows to change and to embrace diversity. "BAFTAs have always been supportive of my career and I am deeply appreciative but I have to say that I also feel very conflicted because so many of my fellow actors that are deserving don't have that same privilege.

I think that is the message we are sending to people who have contributed so much to our medium", said Phoenix. He also acknowledged that he could be part of the problem and vowed to take a stand. "I am ashamed to say that I am part of the problem. I have not done everything in my power ensure that the sets I work on are inclusive", he added.
