South Africa's Lungi Ngidi celebrates taking Australia's Alex Carey's wicket in the second T20 international at St George's Park in Port Elizabeth, South Africa on 23 February 2020. PORT ELIZABETH - Opener David Warner scored an unbeaten half-century in vain as Australia blew what appeared to be a comfortable chase to allow South Africa to claim a 12-run victory in the second Twenty20 International on Sunday. South Africa posted a below-par 158 for four in their 20 overs as Australia strangled their bright start, but were able to defend the total as the wicket slowed up and the touring side found scoring increasingly difficult.

The series is level at 1-1 with the decider to be played in Cape Town on Wednesday, after which the sides will contest three one-day internationals.
