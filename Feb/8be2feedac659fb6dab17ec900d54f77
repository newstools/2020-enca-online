The 28-year-old trade unionist died in detention at John Vorster Square in 1982. An inquest at the time ruled Aggett took his own life. He was said to have hanged himself in his cell with a scarf. But fellow inmate, Sisa Njikelana has revealed a key sighting he withheld during the first inquest. WATCH: Activist believes police killed Aggett “The leg irons on my ankles and I was made to sit in a crouching position, and then the handcuffs on my wrists, and they were linked and then a canvas bag over my head [...] there would be just shocks going throughout my body, vibrations, pain. The whole experience was so intense that every time I would fall on my side and get unconscious,” Njikelana. Firoz Cachalia also revealed how he was tortured by security branch members. Both men believe security branch members killed Aggett. The inquest continues.
