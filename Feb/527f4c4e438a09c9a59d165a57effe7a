READ: Moodey to run for DA top job “I'm running because we need a new type of politics in South Africa, we need a politics that is different. I want to make the party strong and kind and fair. I know those words have connotations that make it seem like you're weak but I believe that's what the party needs to be if it wants to get South Africans to believe in it and be credible....” she said. “At the moment the DA has become a party where one leader of two leaders are at the helm and they seem to make all the decisions while the rest of us are grown around. That is not the way to lead a party,” Ntuli added. Ntuli spoke to eNCA's political editor, Vuyo Mvoko on throwing her hat in the race.
