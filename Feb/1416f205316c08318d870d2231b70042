WhatsApp, acquired by Facebook in 2014, has grown into one of the most-used services in the Facebook "family" of apps, offering free messaging along with voice and video calls. SAN FRANCISCO - The Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp said on Wednesday it now has more than two billion users around the world, as it reaffirmed its commitment to strong encryption to protect privacy. WhatsApp, acquired by Facebook in 2014, has grown into one of the most-used services in the Facebook "family" of apps, offering free messaging along with voice and video calls. "Private conversations that once were only possible face-to-face can now take place across great distances through instant chats and video calling," a WhatsApp blog post said.

The statement said WhatsApp remained committed to its "strong encryption" that enables users to connect privately even amid calls by law enforcement in the United States and elsewhere to provide more access. "Strong encryption is a necessity in modern life. We will not compromise on security because that would make people less safe," WhatsApp said.

WhatsApp is one member of the Facebook app "family" that includes its core social network, Instagram and Messenger. Facebook said recently some 2.89 billion people globally are daily users of at least one of these services. But the growth has also attracted the attention of regulators and activists concerned over the dominance of major tech platforms.
