The State of the Nation Address was delayed for over an hour as MPs raised multiple points of order based on the presence of former apartheid-era president FW de Klerk and Minister of Public Works Pravin Gordhan. UPDATE: EFF MPs leave Parliament The DA's interim leader John Steenhuisen raised a point of privilege, stating in terms of the Powers, Privileges, and Immunities of Parliament Act that the conduct of EFF MPs was an act of contempt and should be referred to the parliamentary committee for disciplinary consequences. The ANC Chief Whip Pemmy Majodina stated the Parliamentary procedures must be amended to prevent disruption of this nature from happening again. READ: EFF objects to FW de Klerk at Sona 2020 Earlier in the evening, during the adjournment of Parliament, Minister for Public Works and Infrastructure Patricia de Lille commented on the issue, stating the MPs should have been asked to leave after Speaker Thandi Modise's ruling was made. "I fought for this democracy, many people died for this democracy many people went into exile for this democracy and if people don't understand what is the meaning of democracy... we all have opinions but it's wrong if you use your opinion to judge other people," said De Lille. "The EFF, many of them, don't know what we went through for the freedom of this country today so I will not be sitting there to be insulted by young people who don't respect the rule of law." Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure Patricia de Lille shared her views on the delay to the State of the Nation Address. Courtesy #DStv403
