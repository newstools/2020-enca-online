South Africa won the first match by one run and England claimed the second by two runs in a tight series ahead of the World Cup in Australia in October. South Africa's innings was boosted by a powerful 66 from 33 balls by Heinrich Klaasen, before he picked out Ben Stokes at mid-off from the bowling of the impressive Tom Curran (2-33). Opener Temba Bavuma, with 49 from 24 balls, gave the home side a fast start at the top of the order, while David Miller (35 from 20) provided a strong finish.

England lost Jason Roy in the second over of their reply, but Jos Buttler (57 from 29) and Jonny Bairstow (64 from 34) put on 91 in 49 balls as the tourists kept up with the required rate. Once they fell, Morgan took up the mantle, dealing only in sixes in a brilliant display of skill and power hitting. He was supported by Stokes (22 from 12) as they put on the partnership that got England over the line, managing 61 from 27 balls before the all-rounder was out with victory in sight. The match brings down the curtain on England's successful tour of South Africa, which included a 3-1 test series victory and three one-day internationals that ended at 1-1.
