LOS ANGELES - Amazon.com Inc Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos is urging a USÂ judge to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed against him by the brother of his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez, Bloomberg reported on Monday.

In March last year, the publisher of the National Enquirer said its reports on Bezos' private life were based on information from a single source, the brother of Bezos' girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez.
