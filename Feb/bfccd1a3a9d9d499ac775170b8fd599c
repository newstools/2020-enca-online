New temperature highs -- monthly, yearly, decadal -- have become commonplace due to the impact of climate change, caused mainly by the burning of fossil fuels, scientists say. PARIS - Last month was the warmest January on record globally, while in Europe temperatures were a balmy three degrees Celsius above the average January from 1981 to 2010. Across a band of countries stretching from Norway to Russia, temperatures were an unprecedented 6C above the same 30-year benchmark, Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) reported in a statement.

The global record last month was 0.03C above the preceding warmest January, also in 2016.

Records also tumbled in specific locations across the northern reaches of the continent. Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 -- which causes global warming -- are now at their highest level in at least 800,000 years.

Current pledges to cut emissions put Earth on a path of several degrees warming by the end of the century.
