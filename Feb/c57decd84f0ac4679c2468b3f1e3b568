The ANC is calling for a forensic investigation into the AbaQulusi Local Municipality in Northern KwaZulu-Natal. VRYHEID - The ANC is calling for a forensic investigation into the AbaQulusi Local Municipality in Northern KwaZulu-Natal. This after a municipal official was arrested for allegedly defrauding the IFP-led entity of almost R4-million and redirecting money meant for Eskom into her own account. The ANC believes other senior officials are involved in corruption at the municipality. "I thinkÂ then what needs to happen, we need to have a forensic investigation," said Zekhele Buthelezi, ANC Secretary of the Mzala Nxumalo region. "A section 106 investigation that checks all the books of the municipality because it is obvious that there has been a lot of fraud and corruption that has been going on in the municipality." The suspect appeared in the Vryheid magistrate's court and bail was set to R30,000, which she hasn't been able to raise yet. She's expected to appear in Durban's Commercial Crime Court on 3 March.
