Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The manufacturer of recalled pilchards is in trouble. The National Consumer Commission says West Point Processors failed to inform it about the recall as per regulations. WATCH: Consumer Commission questions pilchards' recall The commission has now ordered all wholesalers, retailers and informal traders to remove the recalled pilchards from their shelves. A canning deficiency has resulted in a mass recall of Cape Point, Saldanha, Shoprite's RiteBrand, Checkers House brand, U-Brand and OK House brands cans with the code ZST-2 and ZSC-2. It means the product is unfit for consumption. The company remains mum on the recall. WATCH: Consumers speak on pilchard recall The National Consumer Commission Acting Commissioner Thezi Mabuza says no formal communication from the supplier has been received and what's most important is that people don't eat the fish. "Please take the product to the store whether you have a receipt or not. The recall strategy must reach those in far-flung areas." West Point Processors declined to be interviewed.
