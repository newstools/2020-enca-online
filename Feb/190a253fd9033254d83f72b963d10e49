Students are reportedly not happy with the university's alleged decision to demand a 15% upfront payment towards historical debt. JOHANNESBURG - The Student Representative Council at the University of KwaZulu-Natal has distanced itself from clashes with security. On Wednesday morning, videos shared on social media showed burning tyres in the middle of the road and some protestors hurling stones at what appears to be security personnel vehicle. Students are reportedly not happy with the university's alleged decision to demand a 15 percent upfront payment towards historical debt. SRC President Sifiso Simelane said the situation is concerning.

It is maybe an indication of the frustration that the students are facing in light of the mass exclusion that the university wants to implement", said Simelane. The institution's academic programme is continuing as normal with police and security monitoring the situation.
