Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The police tortured and killed anti-apartheid activist Neil Aggett. This was the testimony of former Transvaal Indian Congress leader Prema Naidoo, who was detained at the John Vorster Square police station. The activist's body was found hanging in his cell in 1982 – and an apartheid-era investigation found no-one was to blame. WATCH: Chikane details last time he saw Neil Aggett alive Naidoo says he was tortured and drugged by apartheid police – and found himself involuntarily offering information. “And at some point, I think I feel off to sleep on my feet. And I started talking about things that they never even questioned me about.” Naidoo said the interrogation convinced him that Aggett didn’t commit suicide, but was killed by the police. WATCH : Inquest into death of Neil Aggett continues “I wanted to tell the court and the public at large about the kind of treatment that had been meted out to me. And I have no doubt that Neil Agget got the same treatment, and probably even worse.” Naidoo will continue his testimony when the inquest resumes on Monday.
