Ireland's prop Cian Healy takes part in a training session at the Ichihara Suporeka Park in Ichihara on September 18, 2019, ahead of the Japan 2019 Rugby World Cup. DUBLIN - Ireland prop Cian Healy will miss the final two rounds of this season's Six Nations with a hip injury he suffered during their loss to England, the Irish Rugby Football Union said Tuesday. Healy, 32, left the field in the first half of Ireland's 24-12 defeat at Twickenham on Sunday with what coach Andy Farrell said was a "jarred hip", and a scan has now revealed the full extent of the problem.

Defeat by World Cup finalists England ended Ireland's bid for a Grand Slam but Farrell said they were "100 percent" still in title contention. Former England international and assistant coach Farrell, the father of England captain Owen Farrell, added: "We will take the learnings and the hurt as well. "We will take the disappointment and again we need to make sure we get it (the title race) to the last weekend."
