This is to avoid the danger of paddling through a river on their way to and from school. A new report reveals that it will take 27-years to address the current backlog of pedestrian bridges in the province.

The department says though some interventions are in place, financial constraints are making it difficult to completely eradicate the transport challenge. “Its an issue of competing priorities within the limited budget, we are providing scholar transport as an immediate intervention to those learners,” Mshengu said. “We need about a billion to run effective scholar transport, unfortunately, we don't have that.”
