Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Reining in ill-disciplined members, sorting out race-related policies, and getting the Western Cape off the Eskom grid, these are some of John Steenhuisen's promises, should he become the DA's next leader. Currently in the job in a caretaker capacity following the resignation of Mmusi Maimane last year, Steenhuisen officially launched his leadership campaign in Cape Town on Saturday and says good leaders are not afraid to make difficult decisions. READ: DA's Bonginkosi Madikizela drops out of leadership race "I believe that good leaders are not afraid to take difficult decisions, no matter how unpopular they may be. Being able to make those tough choices no matter how popular they are, because that's what leaders do." This includes clamping down on members who bad-mouth the party in public, and who don't toe the line in councils and legislatures. WATCH: Mbali Ntuli outlines her plans for DA's top job "We have got to end this toxic culture of leaks, personal smears and ugly campaigning because if we don't end it, it's going to end the DA." Steenhuisen says he doesn't believe race-based policies are the way to fix inequality in South Africa. "I want to argue for us to adopt a means test paradigm to ensure that empowerment programmes benefit the people who desperately need them and not the fat cat elites that currently benefit from them." Members will be asked to elect a new leader at the end of May. Watch the video above for more on this story.
