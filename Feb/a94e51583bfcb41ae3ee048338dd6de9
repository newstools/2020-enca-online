CAPE TOWN - The Economic Freedom Fighters left Parliament after disrupting the State of the Nation Address on Thursday with a series of points of order and an adjournment of the House. They chanted "Pravin must fall" before leaving the House. Former Fees Must Fall activist Vuyani Pambo began the confrontation, saying "can the president please sit down" before saying the EFF would help run Parliament.

Pambo said the president should take a short adjournment so that he can make an announcement to the nation regarding Gordhan. Speaker Thandi Modise said the State of the Nation Address is not the platform to address the Gordhan issue and said the EFF was disrupting the proceedings by delaying the delivery of the Sona.

The EFF has previously disrupted Sona proceedings, most famously popularising the "Zuma must fall" and "Pay back the money" chants in the halls of Parliament. After a brief adjournment of the House where members of Parliament and dignitaries assembled outside, the EFF MPs left the House. MPs called for further disciplinary consequences for the EFF MPs' conduct and possible rule changes to the regulations of Parliament.
