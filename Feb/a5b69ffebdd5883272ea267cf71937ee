JOHANNESBURG - Police Minister Bheki Cele will have to ask for an extension to appoint the head of Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid). The previous head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate, Robert McBride's contract ended in February last year. The Ipid act requires the vacancy to be filled within a year, which means the deadline is Friday. The Police Portfolio Committee has resolved that Cele will write to the National Assembly speaker to request an extension. The committee has also urged the minister to speed up the process to nominate a credible candidate.
