The man "did not visit a medical centre inside the ship while he was sailing with us," cruise operator Carnival Japan said in a statement. "According to the hospital where he is staying, his condition is stable and infection was not found among his family members who sailed with him," the statement said.

She said they had been waiting since Monday and had no word of when they would be tested as of early Tuesday. The vessel's departure from Yokohama would be delayed by at least 24 hours to Wednesday or later, Carnival Japan said. - 'Quarantine station' - The cruise ship had already been through a quarantine procedure on Saturday at a port in Naha in Japan's southernmost prefecture of Okinawa, and quarantine officials had issued certificates allowing passengers and crew to land, Suga said. A health ministry official said no one on board at that time showed any symptoms and the case of the man who disembarked in Hong Kong was not known at that time. But after his case emerged, a second quarantine was organised.

Quarantine officials are now checking the condition of everyone on board and testing those with symptoms of illness for the new coronavirus, as well as other infectious diseases, including malaria and Dengue fever, a second health ministry official told AFP. The decision on whether to allow the vessel to dock at Yokohama port and let passengers land on Japanese soil "will be made at the quarantine station," taking into consideration the WHO's estimate of a 10-day incubation period, Suga said.
