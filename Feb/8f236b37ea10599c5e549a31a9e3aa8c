JOHANNESBURG - Economist Azar Jammine says all possible solutions to solve Eskom's problems will be met with resistance. He says a restructure at the utility could help but this is an unpopular option as it brings job losses.

"The only thing to get this energy security going without cost-reflective tariffs is to restructure Eskom but therein lies a danger that you are going to spark social unrest because to restructure means loss jobs in certain areas and this will be extremely unpopular."
