CAPE TOWN - Finance Minister Tito Mboweni has brought some relief to long-suffering South Africans. During his Budget Speech this week, he announced that the public won't see an increase in tax, nor will they pay higher VAT. State capture and the looting of state-owned entities are topics South Africans have strong opinions about. After all, as taxpayers, they feel they have to foot the bill whenever money is wasted. Even with the economic crisis, South Africans are still doing their bit for charity.

By the year 2030, our research tells us that around 2.4 billion people would have joined the middle-class." Charities Aid Foundation Southern Africa estimates that the middle-class will contribute 35 percent of their income to charities. According to Reach for a Dream, charities could still benefit from more donations and more awareness about the work they do. Heidi Rowley from Reach for a Dream said, “I think people are aware but I don’t think they may know what exactly the charity stands for or exactly what our service offerings are." "So I think there may be a misconception as the other offing’s as an organisation we offer to our children.” Small contributions can still help change lives and the middle-class is leading the way.
