File: Eskom wanted the court to review and set aside Nersa's tariff decision. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom has lost its court application to be granted higher tariff increases for the next two years. National Energy Regulator, Nersa, had awarded Eskom increases of 8.1 percent in the current financial year, and 5.2 percent for the next one. In response, Eskom asked the High Court in Pretoria to allow increases of 16.6 percent in April 2020 and 16.7 percent in 2021. Eskom argued that without these tariffs, it and the economy will suffer catastrophic harm.
