KZN Economic Development MEC, Nomusa Dube, is concerned about the province's economy. Chief among these concerns is SAA's cancelling of flights to and from Durban. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - KwaZulu-Natal can't afford to have a single SAA flight to Durban cut. That's according to the province's Economic Development MEC, Nomusa Dube-Ncube. WATCH: Court dismisses interdict by unions in SAA retrenchments SAA has announced it would stop flights between Johannesburg and Durban due to cost-cutting. Dube-Ncube is positive about talks with SAA over a decision to cut flights to Durban. She, however, is worried about the negative impact cutting flights will have on the provincial economy. “For any economy to thrive you need reliable transport but also for us who are involved with business and interested in growing our economy investors want to ensure that they fly in do business and fly out.”
