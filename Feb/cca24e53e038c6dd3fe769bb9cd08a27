Springbok captain Siya Kolisi is sharing his World Cup experiences in Japan with SA's Olympic surfing hopeful Jordy Smith. CAPE TOWN - Springbok captain Siya Kolisi didn't just ride the wave of success with a World Cup win. He's also taking to the water himself. Now, Kolisi is sharing his World Cup experiences in Japan with SA's Olympic surfing hopeful, Jordy Smith.
Kolisi took to the waves like a duck to water and vowed to support Smith during the surfer's journey to the Tokyo Olympics.
"Today was quite awesome. He taught me a bit about surfing. We just got to know each other," said Kolisi. "A lot of the same stuff motivates us, normally family, or where you come from. I'm going to get behind him and get the rest of South Africa to get behind him because I think he, I know he deserves it."  
Kolisi has inspired many in the country and Smith is feeding off that.
"I heard that he kind loves surfing and the ocean, I just thought it be such a great opportunity for me to be able to kind of show him a bit of my world and my life," said Smith. "It was a really special moment."
