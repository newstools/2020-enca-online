Mkhwebane's office says it's disappointed with what they labelled 'blatant lies'. Oupa Segalwe, the spokesperson for the office of the Public Protector, said Mkhwebane was named as one of eight respondents in an application to extend the duration of the commission and filed an explanatory affidavit in an attempt to assist the courts.
