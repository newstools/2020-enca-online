"The spread of such an outbreak requires limitation of movement of people, sometimes keeping people where they are, away from the people who are infected is the safest way of dealing with the disease," he said. "In this case, South Africans who are in China, none of them reported that they are in any specific risk, there is more panic for people who are outside of the country, which is understandable," added Mkhize. So far, the COVID-19 virus has infected more than 72,000 people and killed nearly 1,900.
