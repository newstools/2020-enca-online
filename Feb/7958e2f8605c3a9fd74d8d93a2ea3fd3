File: EFF says De Klerk is "refusing to take responsibility for the crime that apartheid was". JOHANNESBURG - The EFF says it'll explore all legal avenues to reopen a forensic inquest against former president FW de Klerk. This after De Klerk said there was never a crime against humanity under apartheid, and that many people died in black-on-black violence.

He said it’s a fallacy that he didn't apologise for the wrongs of apartheid. “Apartheid was wrong, apartheid was morally unjustifiable,” he said. EFF is accusing De Klerk of "refusing to take responsibility for the crime that apartheid was".
