Parliament says it wants to keep the budget tight, at under R2-million. READ: Thandi Modise anticipates a well-coordinated Sona This will be the second Sona in a single financial year and as part of the belt-tightening, there will again be no lavish dinner for MPs and guests. The junior and civil guard has also been scrapped. Advertising and branding are being kept to a minimum. READ: Sona to cost almost R2m, the lowest in year National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise says Parliament is well under the R7.6 million budgeted for the two Sona events. "We remain vigilant and sensitive to the economic challenges we face, and therefore the budget of Sona has been designed to ensure key features have been retained." Modise meanwhile, is undeterred by threats from the EFF to disrupt proceedings.
