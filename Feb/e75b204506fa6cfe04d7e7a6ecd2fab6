JOHANNESBURG - The DA's Federal Chairperson Helen Zille has announced on Monday that she will be closing her Twitter account. Zille said her decision comes after the "grotesque treatment" of her granddaughter on the social media platform. "After the grotesque treatment of my grand-daughter on Twitter ydy, I am closing this account. I say goodbye to some of my followers, and good riddance to the haters, bots and sock-puppets that constitute such a large percentage of my 1,4-million plus followers', said Zille in a lengthy thread.
