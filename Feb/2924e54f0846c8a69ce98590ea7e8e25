READ: Egypt's Mubarak walks free for first time in six years His story became Egypt's story for the next 30 years until, finally, his people found they could write it themselves, in a 2011 Arab Spring revolution that consigned him to history. An unremarked vice president to Anwar Sadat, he was a stopgap in the anxious days of 1981 after Sadat was gunned down beside him at a military parade. Few thought he would last. Yet slowly, surviving attempts on his own life, he became "Pharaoh", presiding over decades of stagnation and oppression and offering his people a choice: Mubarak or mayhem.

Washington expected him to go on rigging elections till he died, when his son Gamal might take over. "Nobody imagines that we can press a button and freedoms will arrive. Otherwise it would lead the country to chaos and that would be a danger to people," Mubarak once said. Mubarak died aged 91 on Tuesday after undergoing surgery, state television said.
