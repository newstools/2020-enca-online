She took aim at journalists responsible for those stories. Talking to eNCA's Xoli Mngambi about the allegations made by a Sunday newspaper, Ndabeni-Abrahams said, "it is a blatant lie and journalists must adhere to the press code". "Get the reporter who wrote about that to provide evidence. I do realise that it is becoming the norm in this country. Journalists must make sure that when they give information, it is authentic." Ndabeni-Abrahams says she will continue to do her work despite what journalists write about her. Watch the full interview with Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams above.
