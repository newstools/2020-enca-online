The organisation's CEO Wayne Duvenage has more details. #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) says the City of Johannesburg needs to explain how the cost of repairing potholes has ballooned. Joburg mayor Geoff Mkhubo has promised to patch up over 4,000 potholes before the end of February. But he says to resolve the underlying problems, would cost R20-billion. OUTA says the initial cost was estimated to be R7.1-billion in 2017. According to the organisation's CEO Wayne Duvenage, "this is the result of not maintaining the roads for many years. Our research suggests the City of Joburg has underspent in its maintenance across the board. The underspending is in the billions of rands as a result of not focusing on continuous maintenance."
