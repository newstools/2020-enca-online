The Nedbank and Old Mutual Budget Speech Competition was launched in 1972 as a platform to empower and create exposure for the country’s brightest young minds. Now in its 48th edition, the competition has become a highly anticipated annual event that coincides with the national Budget Speech. The competition is open to tertiary students across South Africa and calls on entrants to share their ideas on how to solve key economic and societal challenges, as well as balancing the practicalities of fiscal responsibility, given the competing demands for resources and support from across society.
