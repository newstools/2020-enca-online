The Gangstar Café employs ex-convicts who've been taught various skills while awaiting release at the Drakenstein prison Youth Centre. CAPE TOWN - Former prisoners in Cape Town are now serving coffee instead of time. The Gangstar Café employs ex-convicts who've been taught various skills while awaiting release at the Drakenstein prison Youth Centre. Officials at the facility say since ‪2009, most of the young men who've undergone the reintegration programme have managed to stay out of prison. The café has two branches, in Mowbray and Durbanville. It employs five full-time and four part-time workers. The Message Trust wants to expand the business and to start a rotisserie in Drakenstein prison to offer a wider range of opportunities to former convicts.
