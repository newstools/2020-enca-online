PRETORIA - Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane is accused her staff of being used by external forces to remove her from her position. Mkhwebane’s office has responded to disclosures from Free State Public Protector Sphelo Samuel that she's using her position to fight political battles to the detriment of investigations. This comes as Mkhwebane is rallying up support. Her spokesperson Oupa Segalwe, says the latest disclosures from her staff reveal a plot to oust her, from within. “She has not ruled out the possibility that these staff members may be working with external people who have longed called for her removal from office,” Segalwe said. READ: Turbulent times ahead for Mkhwebane Mkhwebane also thinks the claims have been timed to coincide with a probe into her conduct. “It happens at a time where there is this process in parliament to have her removed from office and it seems from her perspective geared towards influencing the outcome of that process,” Segalwe said. The tide to remove the public protector through Parliament may be swelling, Mkhwebane is consolidating her own base with new appointments and a strategic show of support from within the ANC.
