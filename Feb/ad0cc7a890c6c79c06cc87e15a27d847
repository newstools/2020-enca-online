For now, Maimane says his movement will be funded by its members, and through crowdfunding. "This is a movement that will modernise and focus on our future. I believe this is possible. I don't believe that institutional politics or traditional parties are able to reform" he said. Maimane resigned from the DA in 2019. His resignation followed that of Herman Mashaba as Johannesburg mayor and from the party.

The DA lost about half a million voters, losing five parliamentary seats. An organisational review panel described Maimane as inconsistent, indecisive and conflict-averse. The report was commissioned by Maimane and authored by former DA leader Tony Leon. The panel recommended training for leaders on how to lead a diverse group of people. Maimane was elected leader of the DA in 2015 succeeding Helen Zille.
