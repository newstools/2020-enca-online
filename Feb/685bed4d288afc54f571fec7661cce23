The area was reported unsafe as far back as 1997. Years later, families continue to be left homeless as they wait for the municipality to move them. The sinkholes are spreading and causing damage and destruction in their wake.

This is why we have said this matter must be brought to the attention of the president so that it goes back to the presidential project as it was before.” Sello says they're working together with Cogta and the Housing Development Agency to allocate RDP houses for now, as they deal with safety first.
