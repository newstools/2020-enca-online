JOHANNESBURG - Eskom says there will be no suspension of load-shedding during peak traffic hours on Tuesday. The embattled power utility says stage 2 rotational load-shedding will continue until 6am Thursday. Eskom says this is due to "higher than projected demand", and because some generating units were not able to return to service as expected. "There will be no respite in load-shedding during the peak traffic hours of Tuesday afternoon." According to Eskom, suspending load-shedding during the peak traffic hours is a pilot programme to minimise the impact of load-shedding on the commuting public. Its says any risk based on the available capacity and emergency reserves would determine whether or not it can implement the suspension during peak traffic hours.
