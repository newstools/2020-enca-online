Trade Union federation Cosatu is on a collision course with government. It says government's plan to cut the public sector wage bill by R160 billion means war. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Cosatu is on the warpath and says it will take government to court if public servants are not paid their agreed increase on 1 April. Treasury says its plan to review the public sector wage agreement could save the state R160-billion. But the workers federation says it’s outraged by the review announcement – and has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to take charge and rein in his ministers. READ: Public service wage bill to be reduced Cosatu says it won’t be ambushed and will force the government to pay increases in April. “They’ve implemented year one and year two, this is the last year. We expect it to be implemented. It’s a legal document. It’s enforceable. It enjoys the majority support from the bargaining council and if it’s not enforced we will apply for enforcement,” said deputy president Mike Shingange.
