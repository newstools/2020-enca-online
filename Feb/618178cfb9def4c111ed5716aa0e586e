WASHINGTON - The US Navy and Boeing announced they had flown two fighter jets in exercises under the control of a third jet nearby, proving that multiple pilotless combat missions can be run from a separate aircraft. In experimental tests late last year at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station southeast of Washington, the Navy and Boeing sent two EA-18G Growlers through 21 distinct missions during four flights, with each aircraft being controlled from a third EA-16 nearby.

The flights "proved the effectiveness of technology allowing F/A-18 Super Hornets and EA-18G Growlers to perform combat missions with unmanned systems," Boeing said in a statement.

It is adapted from the F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter jet, used by the Navy and armed with air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles.

"It could provide synergy with other US Navy unmanned systems in development across the spectrum and in other services."
