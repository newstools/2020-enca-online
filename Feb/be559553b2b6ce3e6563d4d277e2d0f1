eNCA's Lindsay Dentlinger spoke to him. #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - DA interim Leader John Steenhuisen is set to face a stiff challenge for the top post at the party's elective congress in May. But Party Western Cape Leader Bonginkosi Madikizela won't be among those seeking to unseat him. Madikizela has confirmed he's opting out saying until the DA has fixed its problems he won't be vying for the top job. He also says his focus, for now, is on retaining his job as a provincial leader. "We need to become a party that's acceptable to many South Africans. I think that's what we have to embark on as the DA." Madikizela adds that the party needs to rebuild following Mmusi Maimane's departure. "It would be disingenuous and naive to downplay the departure of a leader, of course, it had a negative impact, but I don't believe it's as severe as many alarmists want us to believe. The DA is not a one-man party. But we can't ignore the damage the brand has suffered before and after their departure." With Madikizela opting out of the national leadership race, he won't be drawn on who he will be backing, just yet. But he says he's unlikely to change his mind about challenging them.
