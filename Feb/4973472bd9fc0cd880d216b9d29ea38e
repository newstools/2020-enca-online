TSHWANE - Desperate times for students at Tshwane North TVET colleges have led to some students taking desperate measures to survive. Despite being NSFAS beneficiaries, they say they're struggling to get money for accommodation and allowances.

Students relayed their stories of being forced to participate in criminal activities including smash and grabs to get enough money to pay for accommodation. One NSFAS beneficiary claims she was told to get a boyfriend when she asked for her allowance and said she has turned to sex work to support herself.
The Higher Education Department says it's up to the minister to decide whether the college should be put under administration.
