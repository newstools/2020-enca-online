PRETORIA - The agriculture sector wants to push transformation in South Africa, with commercial farmers in the driver’s seat.

That's why former minister Roelf Meyer is spearheading the Agriculture Development Agency (AGDA). “We are of the view that there is sufficient land for everyone who wants to be a farmer," said Meyer.
