Residents have called for all three to resign from their positions. UPDATE: Police on high alert in Mahikeng Community leader Motswakae Chuene said there are a number of issues they want to be sorted out. "The community is complaining about a number of service delivery issues from untarred roads, unmaintained tarred roads, street lights that are not working, blocked sewages and drain pipes...So we feel as a community that the government or the municipality or even the provincial government does not know the conditions under which we live in", said Chuene.
