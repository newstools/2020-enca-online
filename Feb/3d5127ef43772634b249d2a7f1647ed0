Billie Eilish is set to perform the world premiere of the new James Bond theme tune, which shares the same name as the upcoming movie "No Time To Die". LONDON - Teen sensation Billie Eilish is set to premiere her new James Bond theme tune at the Brit Awards on Tuesday, while rappers Stormzy and Dave and indie newcomer Lewis Capaldi will vie for glory at British pop's biggest night. Veteran rocker Rod Stewart is set to close the ceremony, which recognises the country's top pop talent in 2019, while Stormzy and Harry Styles are among the male-heavy lineup due to perform. But Eilish could steal the show on women's behalf. Nominated for best international female solo artist, she is set to perform the world premiere of the new James Bond theme tune, which shares the same name as the upcoming movie "No Time To Die". READ: Billie Eilish drops James Bond track The teenage pop iconoclast unveiled the ballad -- which features the grungy melancholic feel that has propelled her to star status -- to critical acclaim last week. It has already racked up nearly 26 million views on her YouTube channel, capping a remarkable few weeks for the 18-year-old singer who is the youngest artist to record a Bond track. The breakout star swept last month's Grammys, clinching five awards including the "big four" prizes: Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Record of the Year and Best New Artist. The Brit Awards have recognised the cream of British pop music since they were first held in 1977, and have often been peppered with scandal and farce.
