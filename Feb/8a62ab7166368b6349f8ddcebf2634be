Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Plans to cut the public sector wage bill should not come as a surprise. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni says it’s untrue that discussions with labour structures to cut national debt in this way have not already started. Mboweni was briefing Parliament’s finance committees on the 2020 budget. National Treasury hopes it can cut debt by R160-billion over the next three years, if it trims the public service.

Not all MPs are impressed by Mboweni’s austerity plans. Mboweni, a former labour minister, says he knows the rigours of negotiating with unions, all too well. “Naturally people are going to say things publicly... I know how these things start and how they end. Sometimes they end joyfully, sometimes they don’t end joyfully, but that’s life.”
