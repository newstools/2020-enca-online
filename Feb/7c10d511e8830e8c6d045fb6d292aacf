Speaking to the media after his election as Jobug mayor, Makhubo said he wants to provide free water, improve service delivery to the poor – and promised a new budget. JOHANNESBURG - Johannesburg mayor Geoff Makhubo has levelled serious allegations against his predecessor, Herman Mashaba. WATCH: Makhubo briefs media on state of Joburg Makhubo says Mashaba ruined the finances of the metro and that it is now close to collapse. Makhubo has been at the helm since December. The mayor said the Metro police department has been abused by the mayoral office for political ends. He said, "the senior management of JMPD has not had a management meeting in over two years. Financial, operational and governance decisions have been taken unilaterally without support and buy-in from senior management within the organisation who must command and deploy units for duty." Makhubo said new JMPD officers that had been paraded were subsequently recalled to the academy and said they were not fully trained when they were presented to the public as new officers. In response to the allegations, Mashaba said he can't take lessons in finance, ethics or truth from someone who was profiting from a relationship with a Gupta-linked company. Mashaba claimed Makhubo received approximately R30-million through illicit deals with Regiments Capital.
