Courtesy #DStv403 KEMPTON PARK - Environmental Affairs Minister Barbara Creecy has assured that South Africa is committed to reducing carbon emissions. Creecy says while the continent only contributes one-percent to carbon emissions, it's feeling the effect of climate change in the form of cyclones, floods, and drought. The minister met with climate change stakeholders following negotiations in Madrid, Spain, last year. How is South Africa dealing with this phenomenon that threatens to become unstoppable? “One of our challenges is that up until this point we have been more or less 90-percent dependent on coal-fired power generation," Creecy said. "The new IRP indicated that there would be a move from 80-percent dependence on coal to 60-percent and increase renewable.” READ: South Africans encouraged to braai more to save the environment The department has also assured stakeholders that it's crafting a Climate Change Bill. “This bill has been published for public comments it currently before Nedlac wants to synergize the issue of carbon tax and carbon budget. It’s an issue of grave concern to business,” Creecy said. However, some climate change activists say a more pro-active approach is needed. “The easiest thing we can do and urgent thing declare climate emergency and release resources,” said Sunny Morgan from Gauteng Extinction Rebellion. As part of the response to the climate change crisis, South Africa wants to establish a presidential climate change commission. Its task would be to lead to a lower carbon economy while building a climate change resilient society.
