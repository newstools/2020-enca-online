Seabelo Senatla scored a try for the Western Stormers. CAPE TOWN - Speedster Seabelo Senatla scored a superb try for the Western Stormers as they ground out a 13-0 win over the Northern Bulls on Saturday to top the Super Rugby table. Slick handling set up the winger to race clear for a 50th-minute score that proved the last of a dour South African showdown at Newlands stadium in Cape Town. Victory lifted the Stormers to nine points, one more than the Waikato Chiefs of New Zealand and the ACT Brumbies of Australia after two rounds. The Stormers succeeded despite the absence of World Cup-winning Springbok skipper Siya Kolisi and Bongi Mbonambi, who was also part of the team that beat England in the final. Kolisi will be sidelined for up to 12 weeks and Mbonambi could miss the rest of the season after both were injured in a triumph over the Wellington Hurricanes last weekend. The Bulls spent long periods of the second half deep in the Stormers' territory, but their predictability and heroic defending by the home side kept them scoreless. "South African derbies are always going to be physical affairs and there was not much between the teams tonight," said acting Stormers skipper and prop Steven Kitshoff. "Seabelo scored a beautiful try to give us some breathing space and then we had to defend brilliantly to keep the Bulls out." Fly-half Damian Willemse kicked a penalty to give the Stormers an early lead that widened before half-time via a pushover try claimed by hooker Scarra Ntubeni and centre Jamie Roberts.
