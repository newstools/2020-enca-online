File: Cosatu House in Johannesburg. JOHANNESBURG - Cosatu is lashing out at government's plan to review the public service wage agreement for the year. The Public Service Association has also slammed the proposal, saying public servants cannot afford to sacrifice their salary increments. READ: PSA slam government proposal to review 2020 wage agreement Cosatu in a statement has rejected the proposed move labelling it a direct attack on collective bargaining. It says if government smuggles the review into today's budget speech, it will regard the move as a declaration of war. And going forward, there will be a parting of ways with government.
