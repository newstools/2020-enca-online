Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Eskom CEO André de Ruyter has apologised for the historic neglect of maintenance, which has led to load-shedding. Speaking at a media briefing about the utility’s operational performance, he said the board has now given the thumbs up for a new maintenance strategy. WATCH: Eskom delivers system status update Eskom, however, says the public can expect an increase in power cuts. “We will, unfortunately, have to expect some increase in load-shedding. We are going to have to do this in a structured, careful managed way,” he said. De Ruyter said the government's plan to split Eskom into three separate entities - generation, transmission and distribution - is being accelerated.

Eskom’s systems remain constrained with the energy availability at 68 percent – the lowest it's ever been. This means more maintenance and more power cuts.
