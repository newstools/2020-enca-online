Sevu Reece enjoyed a breakout season in 2019, scoring 15 tries to become Super Rugby's leading scorer and forcing his way into the All Blacks ahead of the Rugby World Cup in Japan. WELLINGTON -Â Wing sensation Sevu Reece signed a contract extension Friday that will keep him with the All Blacks and Super Rugby's Canterbury Crusaders until 2022, New Zealand Rugby said. The Fijian-born flyer enjoyed a breakout season in 2019, scoring 15 tries to become Super Rugby's leading scorer and forcing his way into the All Blacks ahead of the Rugby World Cup in Japan. Reece said he had no hesitation about staying in New Zealand. "2019 was a surreal season for me with the Crusaders and All Blacks, so it was an easy decision to extend my time with the Crusaders club and continue to push for higher honours," he said in a statement. Reece has scored four tries in seven All Blacks appearances and his performances in Japan were among the highlights of a disappointing campaign that ended with a semi-final exit for the defending champions. "He's a young player who made great strides in his first season of professional rugby and we look forward to watching his development," All Blacks coach Ian Foster said.
