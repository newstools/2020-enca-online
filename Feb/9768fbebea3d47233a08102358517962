France's flanker Charles Ollivon,Â lock Paul Willemse and wing Teddy Thomas celebrate during the Six Nations rugby union tournament match between France and England. PARIS - France's South Africa-born lock Paul Willemse said he was "scared" by the potential in the squad after opening their Six Nations campaign with a 24-17 victory over England in Paris. Willemse, who played for his hometown side of the Blue Bulls in Pretoria before qualifying for Les Bleus on residency grounds last year, was one of 11 players in the starting lineup with less than 20 Test caps. "The scary thing is that I believe there's lots of room for improvement in our team still so it gives me confidence in the future," Willemse told AFP. "It's a fresh group. All of us have this one mentality to go forward for the next World Cup and it helps a lot. Most of the team is starting our history now, it's like a clean slate," the 27-year-old added. Willemse lined up alongside a fellow South Africa-born player in Bernard Le Roux, who hails from the Western Cape, in their first appearance combining as second-row partners. "We haven't spent too much time playing together. We did our World Cup preparation for one week before I got injured so we spent a bit of time together there but the last two weeks went really well," Willemse said. "We sometimes speak Afrikaans together on the pitch but we kind of have a rugby language on the field. "So you don't speak any language, you speak the rugby language. We have our jargon, talking with certain words. It helps." Willemse and Le Roux made 34 tackles between them as new defence coach Shaun Edwards' impact was seen immediately. The hosts held out England for almost an hour after spending large parts of the game without the ball in their own 22-metre area.
