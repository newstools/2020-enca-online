Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Cosatu is calling on President Cyril Ramaphosa to take action against Finance Minister Tito Mboweni. The federation is upset that he called for a referendum on the use of taxpayer’s money to bail out State-Owned Enterprises on Twitter. Cosatu says the minister must use the proper channels. READ: Mboweni says 'game over' for SA without economic reform Cosatu spokesperson Sizwe Pamla said it is clear that Mboweni does not want to be part of the administration and that he doesn't raise his views at the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac). READ: Cosatu eyes pension funds to rescue Eskom “He sits at Nedlac but he keeps quiet, he doesn’t raise these issues at Nedlac because we have never heard his proposal from him at Nedlac. When he’s at Nedlac he doesn’t say the things that he says on Twitter and that then becomes a problem, because a structure like Nedlac is where we want to hear all views...” said Pamla. Mboweni is set to deliver his Budget Speech next week Wednesday.
