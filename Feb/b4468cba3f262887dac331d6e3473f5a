The city approached the court after the refugees refused to leave the Central Methodist Church and surrounding areas. The more than 700 refugees have been living there since October last year, impacting local businesses, while they demand to be resettled to other countries. READ: Court to rule on Cape Town refugees The City of Cape Town has no jurisdiction inside the church to ask the court to evict them and thus the ruling isn't an eviction order. The court granted an interim order which states the refugees must abide by the city's municipal by-laws and this only extends to the refugees and asylum seekers living outside the Central Methodist Church The refugees are demanding to be moved and resettled to other countries.
