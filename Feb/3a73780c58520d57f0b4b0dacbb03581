He says this paints Zuma as a fugitive, while he's actually sick. The High Court in Pietermaritzburg issued the warrant after the former president failed to appear on Tuesday for his corruption trial. The warrant has been stayed until his next scheduled appearance on 6 May. The former president’s son is fuming after the court doubted his father's medical certificate. "It is something that has always happened. Now, they themselves are questioning a letter that comes from an institution of government.” READ: Zuma is not a fugitive: Mabe Edward says his father’s being persecuted. The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal’s also defending Zuma. “It’s an anomaly that a sick note of the former president can be of such a scrutiny in a court of law to the extent that it becomes doubted by the judges. It’s an anomaly, there’s something wrong with that,” said ANC KZN Seceratary Mdumiseni Ntuli. In a statement, the national ANC says it respects the decisions of the court and calls Zuma a law-abiding citizen who has consistently respected the courts and submitted to judicial processes.
