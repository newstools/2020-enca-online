NEW JERSEY - Golf's ruling bodies have said it is time to rein in the increasing distances players are hitting the ball, a trend they assert is detrimental to the game. The 'Distance Insights Report' leaves the door open to a "bifurcation" of the rules which could lead to elite and recreational players using clubs and balls manufactured to different regulations. The report said that since 2013, the average driving distance on the US-based PGA Tour and European Tour has increased at a rate of about one yard per year, now averaging 294 yards. Top women have shown a similar rate of increase, now averaging more than 250 yards on the LPGA Tour. Such distances can reduce the strategic challenge of many courses, for example by allowing players to avoid the danger of a deep bunker not by accuracy but simply by smashing their drives over the potential trouble. "We believe that it is time to break the cycle of increasingly longer hitting distances and golf courses and to work to build a long-term future that reinforces golf's essential challenge and enhances the viability of both existing courses and courses yet to be built," the report said. "In reaching this conclusion, we recognize that some have the view that the governing bodies might have done more in addressing the implications of the continuing increases in hitting distances and course lengths. "Our views have evolved as events have unfolded and new information has become available ... and we believe that it is never too late to do the right thing for the future of the game."
