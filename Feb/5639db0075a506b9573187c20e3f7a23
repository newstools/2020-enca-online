Zuma was a no show at court last week, citing ill health. READ: 'Hands off Jacob Zuma', says son A judge rejected his sick note and issued a warrant for his arrest, which has been stayed until his next court appearance in May. Magashule says Zuma hasn't attended any National Executive Committee meetings in a while, due to illness. "Well, President Zuma is one person who has attended meetings of the NEC and when we could not see him… it's because he is indeed sick. That's what we know for sure. I have visited him several times and indeed he was not fine. There is a position of the NEC that we cannot prevent anyone to go to the case to support Zuma. People can go there as individuals and we still maintain this position," said Magushule. Zuma is facing corruption charges linked to the multi-billion rand arms deal.
