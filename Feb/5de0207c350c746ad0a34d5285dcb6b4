Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has postponed the release of a forensic report into the death of Parktown Boys' High school pupil, Enock Mpianzi. Lesufi says the department will release the report only once it has the blessings of the 13-year-old boy's family. READ:Â Witness to another drowning where Enock Mpianzi died, speaks out Mpianzi drowned during a school camp in the North West. His body was recovered two days after he went missing. He had been taking part in river rafting. It's alleged that fellow pupils alerted facilitators about Mpianzi's disappearance but were ignored. His death led to the suspension of the school's principal. A preliminary investigation found that the school didn't get approval from the district before embarking on the camp.
