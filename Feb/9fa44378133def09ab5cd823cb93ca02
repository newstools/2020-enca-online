JOHANNESBURG - The North High Court has set aside Tegeta's R3,7-billion coal supply contract with Eskom on Friday. READ: Eskom board lays charges relating to Tegeta contracts The Special Investigating Unit obtained a court order to take legal action against the Gupta-linked mining company. The Tegeta agreement was declared unlawful and invalid. Signed in March 2015, it stipulated that Tegeta would supply coal to Eskom's Majuba power station for 10 years. An SIU investigation into the allegations of maladministration at Eskom was ordered in 2018. SIU spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said the organisation is very excited by the ruling as it indicates the work being done to root out corruption and maladministration in state-owned enterprises is finally yielding results.
