The Presidency says plans are underway to bring those citizens – none of whom have tested positive – home from the epicentre of the COVID-19 virus. Coronavirus: Two South Africans infected on Japanese cruise ship “It’s a military operation and done fall under the auspices of Defence for a very large part of it, particularly, the most practical aspects of carrying out this operation,” said Department of Health spokesperson, Dr Lwazi Manzi. Every precaution will be taken in the process before the affected citizens are quarantined for 21 days. Coronavirus in SA: Not if, but when says expert “An advance team will go to China and will be testing each one of them before they board the aircraft back to South Africa. We will not be able to transport any individual who is infected with COVID-19,” said Department of Health acting director-general, Dr Anban Pillay. Meanwhile, two of the 12 South Africans on board a Japanese cruise liner have become our first confirmed cases. The South African government is on high alert this afternoon, going as far as evacuating locals trapped in China, as the coronavirus spreads to almost 50 countries across the world. Courtesy #DStv403
