Outa and the SA Pilots Association are seeking to declare her a delinquent director. JOHANNESBURG - Former SAA chairperson Dudu Myeni returns to the stand today - this time for cross-examination. Outa and the SA Pilots Association are seeking to declare her a delinquent director. On Thursday, she told the High Court in Pretoria her absence was due to her waiting for director's liability insurance. Myeni says Outa took her on as an individual instead of part of the board. And she finds it unfair to pay out of her own pocket, given that the case is about her role at the national carrier. Myeni's also denied any wrongdoing in the Emirates and Airbus deal.
