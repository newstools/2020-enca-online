Remember way back when the milkman delivered your milk to your doorstep? Well, get ready for the modern version of that much-loved tradition. CAPE TOWN - Remember way back when the milkman delivered your milk to your doorstep? Well, get ready for the modern version of that much-loved tradition. A University of Stellenbosch student is recreating that period at the crack of dawn several days a week. Lekke Fresh uses biodegradable packaging which can be reused as compost. The milkmen then set off for their deliveries to houses around Stellenbosch and Somerset West -- and even fences don't stand in their way! The milk, vegetables and eggs are from farms in the area and the freshly baked bread, from a local bakery. Lekke Fresh is set on expanding its operations to other areas like Durbanville and Franschhoek, so keep an eye out. The milkman might be headed your way!
