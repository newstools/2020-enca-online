And South Africa is no different. READ: SA ramps up coronavirus response Thandeka Nsele from Port Health Services says all passengers arriving at OR Tambo International airport are being screened, but the focus is on high-risk flights. “Every traveler that is coming from international flights...before you even reach the immigration counter, a thermal scanner operator stands a metre away from you, points the thermal scanner, pointed in your face. If the fever temperature is high, we have visual imaging. When the temperature is high, you are then referred to our port clinic for further screening,” said Nsele.
