CAPE TOWN - The family Tazne Van Wyk is pleading with the president for justice. The eight-year-old was murdered outside Worcester in the Western Cape two weeks ago. READ: Body of Tazne Van Wyk (8) has been found, suspect arrested Her body was found on Thursday morning. A 54-year-old suspect is in custody and appeared in court on Tuesday on a kidnapping charge.
Theresa Manuel, the child's grandmother, said, "president, how could you let people like this walk free out of jail, how many children would still have to die, how many Mr President, we ask you how many children more? And I want to tell the man who killed the child, God will find you. The tears that are flowing from their parents, we as family… our tears are not in vain, God will eventually find you" The Elsies River community has also expressed their hurt and outrage at the murder of the little girl. Residents were apparently not aware that the suspect, who lived in the area, was a parolee. They feel let down by the justice system.
