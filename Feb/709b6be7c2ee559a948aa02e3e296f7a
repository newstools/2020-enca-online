File: National Prosecuting Authority headÂ Advocate Shamila Batohi. JOHANNESBURG - Charges have been withdrawn against members of the so-called SARS rogue unit'. Ivan Pillay, Andries Janse Van Rensburg and Johan Van Loggerenberg faced charges of installing surveillance equipment and bugging the offices of the Directorate of Special Operations in the NPA. The National Director of Public Prosecutions, Shamila Batohi says the Panel reviewing the matter concluded that there are no reasonable prospects of a successful prosecution. The issue has dragged out in court for a while. Last year Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwenbane found the trio had acted unlawfully. The Three have always maintained their innocence.
