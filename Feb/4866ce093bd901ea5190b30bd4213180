SAN FRANCISCO - Billionaire Amazon chief Jeff Bezos has purchased a Los Angeles-area estate for $165-million (approximately R2-billion), setting a new record for the region, The Wall Street Journal reported. Bezos bought the Warner Estate from media mogul David Geffen, according to the Journal. It said the deal topped a Los Angeles-area home price record set last year when Lachlan Murdoch paid around $150 million for a Bel-Air estate seen in "The Beverly Hillbillies," a 1960s television show. The Warner Estate spans 3.6 hectares in Beverly Hills. It is a Georgian-style compound with a floor once owned by Napoleon, guest houses, a tennis court, and a nine-hole golf course.
