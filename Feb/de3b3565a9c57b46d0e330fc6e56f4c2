As part of the South African Plastics Pact, these big businesses have committed to redesigning all plastic packaging, to be reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. Some supermarkets have already implemented packaging-free zones, as the first step towards a South Africa where no plastic is wasted.

They've committed to create a new, circular plastic economy and reach targets like eliminating single-use plastics by 2025.
