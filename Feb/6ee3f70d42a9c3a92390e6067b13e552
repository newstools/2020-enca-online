UKZN students have been protesting over what they call “financial exclusion” of some students. Courtesy #DStv403 DURBAN - KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala has intervened in order to resolve the impasse between students and the University of KwaZulu-Natal. Since the beginning of the year, the institution has been dealing with violent protests and destruction of property. Students are demanding that those among them with historical debt are allowed to register but the university says it has already compromised enough. READ: Classes suspended at TUT amid protest Close to 5,000 students at UKZN have still not registered and that is 15-percent of the institution’s total enrolment figure. The university says it is owed more than R600-million in student fees. No lectures have taken place since the beginning of the year. Buildings were reportedly torched and staff attacked. Now Zikalala has stepped in and says they're trying to find a lasting solution.
