They say the recent warrant of arrest issued for him by the High Court in Pietermaritzburg is a clear indication that he's being vilified. On Tuesday, ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule said no one will be stopped from supporting Zuma at his corruption trial.

Niehaus has described Zuma as the father of radical economic transformation and at the heart of pro-poor resolutions of the ANC. Last week, Zuma was a no show at court citing ill health.

Niehaus says the warrant of arrest is unnecessary and is being used as a tool to attack Zuma. “That warrant of arrest is used now in the media to vilify president Zuma, to call him a fugitive of justice and to ridicule him as a former statesman, unacceptable,” he said.
