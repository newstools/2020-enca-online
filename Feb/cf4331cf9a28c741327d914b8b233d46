In a new strategy it will suspend the schedule between 6am and 9am every morning to assist the rush-hour commute. READ: Eskom CEO apologises Load-shedding was scheduled to end on Monday morning, but will have to continue due to what Eskom terms unplanned outages and breakdowns. The power utility says its system is constrained and its emergency resources are depleted. It's urging consumers to use electricity sparingly. READ: Stage 2 load-shedding set to continue until Monday "We regret that load-shedding has a negative impact on South Africa," the utility said in a statement. "Critical maintenance is being done to units on planned outages as well as some of those on unplanned outages to ensure timeous return to service."
