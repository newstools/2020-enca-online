BETHAL - Alleged unlawful business practices by a Mpumalanga security company could see the regulator shutting its doors for good. eNCA brought you the story of Sniper Protection Services allegedly employing underage, untrained and unregistered security guards. The Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (PSIRA) is investigating. Walter Stander owns Sniper Protection Services in Bethal in Mpumalanga. He's a controversial figure who murdered his wife in 1999 and faced a host of charges over the years -- from indecent assault to rape. Despite this, the law is clear: his company can be accredited. READ: Security company scrutinised following child exploitation allegations Head of law enforcement at PSIRA Linda Mbana said Stander disclosed he was convicted and sentenced for murder when applying for accreditation. "A person can apply if that person can prove that the conviction, as well as the sentencing, was done 10 years before the person came to apply to us." Mbana said the organisation would be investigating other allegations of illegal conduct, including issuing security personnel with swords and security staff covering their faces.
Staff were not paid in terms of the national minimum wages. "We are working hand in glove with the Department of Labour so that they can do their own inspection," said Mbana.
Stander said he won't be commenting at this time.
He has five days to give reasons why he and his company's registration shouldn't be suspended.
