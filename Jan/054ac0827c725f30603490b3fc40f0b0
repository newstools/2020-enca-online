As most people look forward to ushering in the year 2020, runners have found another way to mark the end of the year. JOHANNESBURG - The Katlehong Athletics Club hosted its annual 31 kilometre School Shoe Run to close off the year. Hundreds of runners enjoyed overcast conditions in Ekurhuleni as they set off on the last long run of the year. Among them were seasoned athletes, as well as those set on getting through the kilometres as leisurely as possible.
With just two weeks to go to the start of the new school year, the Katlehong Athletics Club has added a twist to their event.
While participants enjoy the running, the shoe run provides added motivation.
Besides the shoes brought in by runners, at least R8,000 has also been raised that will go towards learners in the new year.
