JOHANNESBURG - South African Airways still needs an additional R2-billion in funding. READ: SAA business rescue process struggling to get off the ground Lenders have provided R2-billion required in December last year, allowing the airline to pay salaries but the airline is waiting on the national government for another cash injection. The concern is, if the funding is not secured, how will the airline's operations be impacted? The ANC NEC meeting taking place over the weekend will be focusing on the state of SOE's and the question of funding the national carrier will probably be discussed. Meanwhile, the South African Cabin Crew Association and NUMSA say the government is being negligent in not making funds available.
