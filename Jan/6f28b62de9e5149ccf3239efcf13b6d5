JOHANNESBURG - Shosholoza Meyl has apologised to passengers after they were stuck on a train travelling from Johannesburg to Cape Town for nearly 24 hours. What's more, another train sent to collect the commuters at Prince Albert Road station also broke down. “Management acknowledges and regrets the unpleasant experience that we have caused to our passengers who travelled between Joburg and Cape Town on Sunday, 5 January 2020," said Prasa's head of communications, Daisy Daniel. "It is still our plea to say we got the responsibility to make sure that we give our customers a pleasant experience.” Passengers were finally bussed to Cape Town on Tuesday. Disgruntled commuters say they've lost faith in the train industry and are accusing the Passenger Rail Agency of not maintaining trains. Commuters were forced to make alternative sleeping arrangements after their train broke down and some say they missed work due to the delay.
