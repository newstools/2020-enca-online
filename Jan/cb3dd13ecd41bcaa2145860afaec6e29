No load-shedding is expected today, however, Eskom continues to warn the country the system remains constrained and vulnerable. JOHANNESBURG - There's been no load-shedding scheduled so far this year, but the grid remains constrained. Eskom has lost another 13,000 megawatts because of breakdowns. The utility said technical teams are monitoring the situation and will carry out planned maintenance.

One energy expert says you should brace for more power cuts this year as maintenance isn't done regularly. "There's no end to the blackouts, certainly not until for five years after they've sorted out a new coal agreement because it takes five years to open up a new coal mine," said Ted Blom.

They have put tenders out but they haven't actually engaged in long-term negotiations and signing of contracts." Blom said if Eskom doesn't get the additional five gigawatts spare capacity to alleviate the situation, we can look forward to rolling blackouts, major breakdowns and erratic power. Eskom has urged the public to switch off geysers and non-essential appliances to assist in reducing demand.
