The area's been under lockdown as residents protested, demanding their removal. They're blaming them for a spate of murders in the area including the killing of a police officer. “I want to emphasize that most people who are not documented don't want to be documented because they came here to commit a crime. Because those people that come here as migrants fight to get documents. Now the fact that people just remain here and even kill police because they are undocumented is because they don't wanna be seen, they don't wanna be known they don't want their fingerprints to be captured. Please don't confuse them with migrants,” he said.
