Lenders have forked out R2-billion of their own as part of the business rescue process. It's not clear where government will get the money from. Government has spent about R16.5-billion in bailouts to keep saving SAA in the air over the past decade. Liquidity has been a major concern at the airline.

That plan is being finalised. A quantum of funds is required to enable that plan,” said Kgathatso Tlhakudi, acting director-general of public enterprises.
