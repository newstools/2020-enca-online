LONDON - Prince William announced what was described as "the most prestigious environment prize in history" to encourage new solutions to tackling climate change. The Earthshot Prize will be awarded to five people every year over the next decade, and aims to provide at least 50 answers to some of the greatest problems facing the planet by 2030. They include promoting new ways of addressing climate change and issues surrounding energy, nature and biodiversity, the oceans, air pollution and fresh water. William said the Earth was "at a tipping point" and faced a "stark choice". "Either we continue as we are and irreparably damage our planet or we remember our unique power as human beings and our continual ability to lead, innovate and problem-solve. "Remember the awe-inspiring civilisations that we have built, the life-saving technology we have created, the fact that we have put a man on the moon. People can achieve great things. "The next 10 years present us with one of our greatest tests -- a decade of action to repair the Earth," he said. Who is ready to lead as we make the 2020s a decade of action to repair our planet?
