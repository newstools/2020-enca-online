Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng CoGTA MEC Lebogang Maile says DA councillors Vasco Da Gama and Katlego Mathebe both undermined the Constitution.

On Tuesday, Maile held a briefing to explain his decision to suspend them, which he has since rescinded.

"One of the fundamental reasons that led to the decision to suspend both councilors giving them three and six months without pay was that they acted in a manner which puts personal interests above those of the residents of the two cities, but they also undermined the Constitution," Maile said. "Our decision to suspend both councillors was not taken lightly or was it neither informed by party politics, it was in the spirit of cooperative governance, so the merit and the correctness of our decision remains."
