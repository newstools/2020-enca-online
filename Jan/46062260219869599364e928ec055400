Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - South African Airways (SAA) says it's not leaving passengers stranded. This after the airline had to re-look its flight schedule and consolidate certain flights. Liquidity remains a pressing issue as National Treasury has not yet secured the R2-billion cash injection that SAA needs. The airline says there has been no serious passenger impacted after it announced it will be reviewing flights and consolidating services based on low demand. SAA has cancelled a number of domestic flights including two international flights. READ: SAA in limbo as it awaits R2bn bailout “There is no need to panic because consolidation is a phenomena and a process different from cancellation. When we speak of consolidation we have to count how many passengers for example, who could be flying on two separate flights to be accommodated on a single aircraft. We have one airplane operating on one aircraft,” said SAA spokesperson, Tlali Tlali. But the airline says there is no need to panic as passengers will still be able to fly. READ: How far can SAA fly? Meanwhile, National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) says the fact that the airline has still not gotten word on when government will provide the R2-billion cash injection is deeply concerning. “What we are trying to do now as unions is to fight for that process, SAA must be turned around. SAA the way it has been run must be radically changed,” said Numsa spokesperson, Phakamile Hlubi-Majola. The union also says it believes the business rescue process is in jeopardy. The airline will communicate in the next coming days if it will be consolidating more flights.
