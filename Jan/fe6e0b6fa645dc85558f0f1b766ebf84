 Anrich Nortje of South Africa celebrates the wicket Ben Stokes of England during the International Test Series 2019/20 match between South Africa and England at Imperial Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg on 24 January 2020 JOHANNESBURG - World cricketer of the year Ben Stokes had an angry altercation with a spectator after being dismissed on the first day of the fourth and final Test against South Africa at the Wanderers Stadium on Friday. Stokes, the outstanding player in a series which England lead 2-1, stopped briefly as he left the field and appeared to challenge a spectator, who evidently insulted him after the player was out for two. "Come say that to me outside the ground, you fucking four-eyed c*nt," Stokes said, according to television footage captured as he left the field and started to climb the steps leading to the dressing room.

The England all-rounder, who had been dismissed for just two, could face disciplinary action for uttering an audible obscenity, which is a level one offence according to the International Cricket Council's code of conduct. England media manager Danny Reuben said after play that Zak Crawley, the England player appearing at a close-of-play press conference, would not answer questions on the incident. England were 192-4 at the end of the rain-shortened first day.
