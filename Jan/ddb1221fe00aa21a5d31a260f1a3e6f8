Tesla CEO Elon Musk dances during the Tesla China-made Model 3 Delivery Ceremony in Shanghai. SHANGHAI - Tesla CEO Elon Musk presented the first batch of made-in-China cars to ordinary buyers on Tuesday in a milestone for the company's new Shanghai "giga-factory". The eccentric entrepreneur danced awkwardly, gave out high-fives, and mugged on a stage as sleek Model 3 sedans -- the company's mid-price, mass-market offer -- were driven up one by one and presented to buyers who jumped into the back seats before being driven away at the plant. The factory is the company's first outside the United States and a key step forward in Musk's strategy of going global. Musk said it was just the start of what will be a growing investment in China by the California-based electric-vehicle pioneer. "We intend to continue making a significant investment and increasing that investment in China, making the Model 3 and the Model Y, and future models also in China," he said. Tesla has said the multi-billion-dollar plant is producing more than 1,000 vehicles per week. It has already delivered a small batch of Model 3s on December 30 to employees who had pre-ordered them. Those being driven away at Tuesday's event were the first for regular consumers.
