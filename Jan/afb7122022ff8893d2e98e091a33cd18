File: South African Kevin Anderson won his first match since returning to competitive tennis at the inaugural ATP Cup team event on Monday. SYDNEY - Fit-again South African Kevin Anderson won his first match since returning to competitive tennis with a 6-0 6-3 victory over Chile's Cristian Garin at the inaugural ATP Cup team event on Monday. Anderson, runner-up at the 2017 US Open and Wimbledon a year later, played only five tournaments last year due to injury before undergoing knee surgery in September. The 33-year-old lost 7-6(5) 7-6(6) to Novak Djokovic in his return to action on Saturday, his first match since the third round of Wimbledon in July, but proved too good for Garin.

"Got off to a really good start and I feel like a lot of things we have been working on, I was able to implement them," Anderson said in Brisbane. "A little bit physically draining after my first match. It's always, as much as you work off the court, it's always a little bit different being in a match environment. "But a really good day of recovery yesterday and my body felt really good being out there today."
