"We will have to give ourselves the space to fix what needs to be fixed," he said. De Ruyter cautioned if the maintenance plan is not implemented, there would be a risk that the system performance would deteriorate further. Eskom resumed stage 2 load-shedding on Friday and it will last until 6am on Monday. It says this is due to a shortage of generation capacity and depleted emergency resources. Three big units will also be switched off for planned maintenance Friday. The parastatal once again apologised to South Africans for the impact its decisions have on the country. Eskom has assured the nation that critical maintenance is being done to various units to ensure the lights stay on.
