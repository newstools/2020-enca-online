"We are concerned with this latest violence as NUM, it is still threatening our stability as a company here and our jobs seem to be on the line because we don't know what is going to happen if these things escalate," Philani Nhlenyama of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). "Most of them are scared (workers), they don't know who is attacking them. We remain concerned as employees as some will be scared to come and talk freely."
