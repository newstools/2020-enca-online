File: Scopa says non-compliance leaves the state vulnerable to crime, fraud and mismanagement. JOHANNESBURG - Parliament's Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) said it won't be taking its foot off the pedal in holding ailing state-owned entities accountable. An inquiry into Medupi and Kusile power stations could also be in the offing.

This stopgap measure that is put in place does not inspire confidence because it glosses over accountability and oversight because it seeks then to say the problems at Eskom were the problems of an individual,” said Scopa chairperson, Mkhuleko Hlengwa. Hlengwa says now's also the time to consider a parliamentary probe into Eskom's new power stations.

They've become a milking cow and a self-enrichment platform for those who want to loot the resources of the state.” While the decision to dissolve the Prasa board has been lauded, Hlengwa wants the individuals to be declared delinquent directors. SAA will also not be escaping Scopa's radar in 2020 but Hlengwa says it wants to give the business rescue practitioner time to get to grips with the issues, before summoning him to Parliament.
