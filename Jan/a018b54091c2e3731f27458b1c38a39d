Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) is proposing a quota system for the employment of foreign nationals. This is the party's call to deal with the high unemployment rate, especially among the youth. The IFP says it'll be introducing a private members’ bill to Parliament this year with proposals on how to achieve this.

And if we are going to exacerbate the unemployment of South Africans, by employing people from outside of the country, to do tasks that we could perform, then I think we are going on a dangerous path,” he added.
