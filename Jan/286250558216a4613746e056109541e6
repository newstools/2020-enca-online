Marc Leishman of Australia plays his shot from the 11th tee during the final round of the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines South. LOS ANGELES - Australia's Marc Leishman fired eight birdies in a seven-under par 65 on Sunday to win the US PGA Tour title at Torrey Pines by one stroke from overnight leader Jon Rahm. Leishman started the day four shots behind Spain's Rahm, but his storming run on Torrey Pines' South Course gave him a 15-under total of 273. "Playing well helps," said Leishman, who has come from behind in all five of his PGA Tour victories. "I didn't actually hit it that well off the tee today, so I don't know what the knack is. Putting, always, you're not going to win tour events if you're not putting well. "I putted probably as good as I've ever putted today," added Leishman, who had five birdies on the front nine. He drained par-saving putts at the 12th and 14th, and rebounded from his ony bogey of the day at 17 with a birdie at the last that proved enough for victory. Leishman's victory came on Australia Day -- also the same day that fellow Aussie Lucas Herbert claimed his first pro victory at the Dubai Desert Classic. Tiger Woods missed the green on his opening approach and began with a bogey but dropped his approach inches from the cup at the second to set up a birdie and added another tap-in birdie at the par-5 sixth to pull within three strokes of the lead. The 15-time major champion finished with four birdies in a two-under 70 that left him tied for ninth on 279. He remains in search of a record 83rd career PGA Tour victory -- having tied Sam Snead's mark at the Zozo Championship in Japan in October.
