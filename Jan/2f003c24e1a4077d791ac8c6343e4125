People continue to relax on the beaches, under the watchful eye of rescue personnel. JOHANNESBURG - Several people drowned on New Year's Day. The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) says it remains on alert until the end of the festive season. It's urging the public to swim where there are lifeguards. NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon said there were drowning incidents down the coast from Durban, East London and Port Elizabeth to Betty's Bay in the Western Cape.

"There are a lot less incidents of what we believe we've experienced in previous years." Lambinon urged parents to ensure that there is adequate adult supervision for children while they are swimming.
