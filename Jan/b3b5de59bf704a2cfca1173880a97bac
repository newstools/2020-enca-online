READ: End of an era as Siyabonga Nomvethe announces retirement “I have already spent six months not doing anything. I wasn’t expecting I would come back and play again and because of the situation the team approached me and said I have to come and help the team." The former Bafana Bafana player admits it’s been difficult sitting at home doing nothing after his retirement. The PSL’s all-time leading goal scorer added that he was disappointed at AmaZulu for failing to deliver on the role they had promised. “I was very disappointed you know not having a job and every time when I wake up in the morning I have to take the kids to school after that I’m not doing anything. It was hard to sit down that’s why I was thinking you know it will be better if I go back and play.” Nomvethe made his debut for Uthongathi this past weekend against Free State Stars. Uthongathi are second of the log after 17 games with 31 points.
