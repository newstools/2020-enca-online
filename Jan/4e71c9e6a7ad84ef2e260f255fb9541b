Coco Gauff of the US hits a return against Romania's Sorana Cirstea during their women's singles match on day three of the Australian Open tennis tournament. MELBOURNE - Fifteen-year-old prodigy Coco Gauff recovered from a set down to reach the Australian Open third round on Wednesday, setting up a mouthwatering meeting with reigning champion Naomi Osaka. The American teenager, playing just her third Grand Slam and her first at Melbourne, celebrated wildly after defeating Romania's Sorana Cirstea 4-6, 6-3, 7-5. Japan's Osaka, a relative veteran at age 22, defeated the fast-rising Gauff in straight sets in the third round of last year's US Open in their only previous match. "It was emotional," the young American, ranked 67 in the world, told Melbourne Arena after her latest scalp. Gauff stunned seven-time Grand Slam winner Venus Williams in the first round, repeating her victory over the veteran American on her Major debut last year at Wimbledon. Gauff reached the fourth round at Wimbledon, where she lost to eventual champion Simona Halep. "I never thought I would have so many people supporting me," she added after dumping out Cirstea. Of her looming showdown on Friday with two-time Grand Slam winner Osaka, Gauff said: "She's a great competitor so I think it's going to be a good match."
