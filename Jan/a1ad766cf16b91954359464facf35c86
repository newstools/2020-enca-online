DURBAN - A Durban man was set free after being accused of raping a teenage girl. The circumstances over his release are being questioned. An Umlazi magistrate set him free because he carried a bag, styled his hair and did the washing. The magistrate concluded he must be gay and not interested in women.

Tilley said the next steps would be to suspend the judge involved while the cases are investigated. "The commission should certainly be stepping in sooner rather than later," she said. Tilley explained suspending a magistrate is not a straight-forward process and requires going to Parliament before it can be completed.
