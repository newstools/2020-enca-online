The clinic services around 150,000 people but right now, it can help only 400 patients a day. READ: Cape Town clinic torched And it's those who need the clinic most, who are affected. Although break-ins at this clinic aren't unusual, this time, the community believes it could be an inside job. “It’s difficult to estimate the time frame of how long it will take to restore the clinic to its full functionality," said the City of Cape Town's Zahid Badroodien. Police are still searching for suspects.
