WATCH: Ramaphosa delivers ANC January 8 Statement Amid calls that Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan should also go and follow former Eskom chairperson Jabu Mabuza -- who resigned on Friday -- Ramaphosa defended his minister, saying he was doing a good job given the circumstances. READ: Jabu Mabuza resigns as Eskom board chair "It may be slow, and Eskom holds the fortunes and the lives of South Africans in its hands and it has a very debilitating effect but we are going to be addressing all those issues. "As I've said in the past, I ask South Africans to be patient and to give the new management time to bed everything down, go on with the maintenance process and give the new board that we're going to appoint, time. "We're not sleeping on the job, we are working continuously to address all these issues," he said.
