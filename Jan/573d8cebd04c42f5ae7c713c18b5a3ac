In a first of its kind in Africa, the Amber Alert tool, notifies the Facebook community when a child is reported missing. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Police Service is partnering with social media giant Facebook, to help find missing children. In a first of its kind in Africa, the Amber Alert tool, notifies the Facebook community when a child is reported missing. Users can instantly share important information about the missing child to help trace them. "We saw people who use Facebook were already doing this, they were sharing information about missing children. What we did we created a tool to make it a more organised way to get the right information to the right people at the right time," said Emily Vacher, Facebook's Director of Trust and Safety. Vacher says an alert with a picture and a description of a child will be sent to people in that specific search area. She says Amber Alert has been launched in 22 countries and a number of children have been saved a result of seeing Amber Alert on Facebook.
