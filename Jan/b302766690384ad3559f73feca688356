PRETORIA - Mamelodi Sundowns head coach Pitso Mosimane downplayed the importance of the crunch Absa Premiership encounter against Orlando Pirates at Orlando Stadium on Wednesday night. Sundowns are in a tense battle with Kaizer Chiefs and Bidvest Wits for this season’s league honours. Mosimane says the match against Pirates is not a must win despite the fact that the defending champions are nine points behind log leaders Amakhosi in the standings. “May is too far guys to do must wins, no we are going a long way hey, we have Pirates twice hey. We have SuperSport again we have Kaizer Chiefs fortunately we have dealt with Wits and you know there’s always the odd ones that are always going to trick you there somewhere somehow so this thing is too far. I'm talking about my team because I know my team and we are running our own race,” he said.

The new Buccaneers coach claimed Sundowns are favourites for this match but Mosimane is not buying into that. “We can’t say we are favourites they are the ones who are favourites we drew our last match they won 4-1. I'm talking about in the league that’s where they are that’s where we are, so we respect them a big team we are playing in Orlando its never easy for us to go there and we also respect the new coach, I mean I should hide my CV if I have to compare my CV to him.” Sundowns will be without influential midfielder Themba Zwane for this clash due to suspension.
