The DA has laid charges of fraud against the ANC chief whip and chairperson of the party's caucus. Thursday's sitting is set to discuss motions of no confidence against the DA mayor and Speaker. WATCH: Battle for Tshwane: ANC rubbishes DA's forgery claims The co-operation between the ANC and EFF has left the DA in the minority. The DA claims its investigation has uncovered forgery by the ANC in Tshwane. It says the petition submitted by the ANC to the City of Tshwane's Speaker on 3 January had at least seven fraudulent signatures on it. DA councillors say had no choice but to approach the authorities.

I think those are the answers that the ANC will have to give to SAPS." But the ANC says there was no forgery. It's dismissed the criminal charges as a red herring ahead of Thursday's special council sitting.

"No-one forged anything. I am telling you, you must know and you must tell the speaker, you are playing politics, and very dirty gutter politics." The police will now investigate whether the signatures were indeed forged. Watch the video above for more.
