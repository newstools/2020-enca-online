CAPE TOWN - A sea turtle is undertaking the longest tracked migration of any marine creature -- ever. Yoshi the loggerhead was released in 2017 after more than 20 years in captivity at the Two Oceans Aquarium in Cape Town. She's swum thousands of kilometres since and even attracted the attention of international scientists. This is the first time a sea turtle has been successfully released after so many years in captivity. Yoshi was the size of a dinner plate when she was brought here in 1997. When she was released, she was more than 100 centimetres long and 90 centimetres wide. Thanks to a satellite chip mounted on her back, Talitha Noble and her team have been able to keep in touch. Noble says she's excited to see where Yoshi originally came from because she'll probably return there to lay her eggs.
