You now in a different spot and people are wanting to be partners with you, but you have existing partners. And we loyal to our partners, because they were loyal to us. In 2016 when we lost all our sponsors when government failed us on our transformation targets, our sponsors all left us. So I think we in a good space as far as South African rugby is concerned. Even this team, the bulk of this team will be around in 2023. It is tough out there, the sponsorship market is tough and the sponsor you have, you must nurture them,” said Alexander.
