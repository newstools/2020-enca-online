This after the power utility reintroduced stage 2 rotational power cuts from 10 pm on Saturday. It said this is due to a conveyor belt failure at Medupi Power Station. Last month, President Cyril Ramaphosa promised there would be no load-shedding into January. Political analyst Asanda Ngoasheng says there seems to be something about Eskom that the government isn't telling South Africans. “Government needs to bring us into its confidence and say this is the reality and this is the truth,” Ngoasheng said. On top of sporadic blackouts, Eskom has nearly R500-billion in debt. Last year it posted a loss of R20-billion, and it's likely to continue losing a similar amount, or even more, this year. Rubbing salt in the wound, latest media reports say the power utility is planning to pay out R1,8-billion in performance bonuses.
