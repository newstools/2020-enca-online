BRUSSELS - NATO has suspended its training missions in Iraq, a spokesperson for the alliance said Saturday, following the US killing of Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani. The NATO mission in Iraq, which consists of several hundred personnel, trains the country's security forces at the request of the Baghdad government to prevent the return of the Islamic State jihadist group.
