US President Donald Trump. WASHINGTON -Â US President Donald Trump said Iran appeared to be "standing down" after missile strikes on US troop bases in Iraq that resulted in no American or Iraqi deaths. "All of our soldiers are safe and only minimal damage was sustained at our military bases. Our great American forces are prepared for anything," he said in an address to the nation from the White House.

No American or Iraqi lives were lost." Trump announced the United States would be imposing "additional punishing sanctions" on Iran but made no mention of possible retaliation to Tuesday's missile attacks -- seen by experts as a measured first response by Iran to the killing of General Qasem Soleimani in an American drone strike. He urged world powers including Russia and China to abandon the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran and work toward a new agreement. "We must all work together toward making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer and more peaceful place," he said. - Additional reporting Reuters
