This year will be tougher for South Africa economically and politically. That's according to Political Analyst Ralph Mathekga. He says 2020 could be the year of intense conflict among the various interest groups jostling for political power. Also, the ANC is preparing for its January 8 statement and 108th birthday celebration in the Northern Cape. Mathekga joins us in the studio.

Ralph Mathekga says it could be the year of intense conflict among the various interest groups jostling for political power. Mathekga argues that even if political parties differed in ideology, some issues needed a non-partisan approach. He added that South Africans are no longer harbouring illusions of the new dawn. “It's not working. I would say he is under siege, not only within his own party but even when he speaks out openly, there seems to be more suspicion that Mr President it seems as if you are not showing that firm hand...it seems as if the president is just managing a crisis,” he said. Meanwhile, the ANC is preparing for its January 8 statement and 108th birthday celebration in the Northern Cape.
