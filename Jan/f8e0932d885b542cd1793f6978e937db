JOHANNESBURG - Eskom has announced on Sunday, Stage 2 load shedding will be implemented throughout the country until Monday. READ: Why your cellphone loses signal during load-shedding The power utility had previously released a statement indicating load shedding would be taking place from Saturday 10 pm to 8 am on Sunday morning. Due to power loss from a conveyor belt failure at Medupi power plant, the load shedding will be extended to Monday at least. Eskom said the system was severely constrained and vulnerable. It's asking South Africans to reduce power usage, as part of efforts to reduce the possibility of further loadshedding.
