LOS ANGELES -Â The Los Angeles Lakers, reeling from the death of team icon Kobe Bryant, "want to represent what Kobe was about" as they press ahead with the NBA season, coach Frank Vogel said on Wednesday. "We want to represent what Kobe was about more than anything," Vogel said. "We've always wanted to make him proud, and that's not going to be any different here." Vogel said the club had a simple directive for players still coming to terms with Bryant's death in a helicopter crash on Sunday: "You guys can speak when you're ready, and not before." But the timetable for returning to NBA action is set, with the Lakers to host the Portland Trail Blazers at Staples Center arena on Friday. That is less than a week since Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven other people were killed when the Sikorsky S-76 helicopter slammed into a rugged hillside in thick fog in Calabasas, northwest of Los Angeles. READ: Vanessa Bryant 'completely devastated' over Kobe's death When the team convened on Tuesday, Vogel said, they "did some things that we thought would be therapeutically beneficial. "We got in the gym for some team shooting work, no real practice working on anything in particular. I wanted our guys to come in mentally free but to get a sweat, touch the ball and be around each other. "Then we had a lunch where we all just spent time together and grieved together." That lunch reportedly included sharing tales of Bryant, but Vogel found himself unable to offer any such reminiscences on Wednesday.
