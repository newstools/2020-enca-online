Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Parents have called on the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) to relook its processes. The NSFAS receives thousands of applications every year, but parents and students say they're battling with several issues. These include the online portal and a lack of communication. Some parents spoke to eNCA about the problems they've experienced. Fatima Damon has two sons in desperate need of funding for their studies in 2020. Damon says she's contacted the call centre numerous times but had no response and she's very concerned. "Because I’m thinking if I am going to send my son to go and register. He is going to be blocked because he doesn’t have the R3500 to register. And he doesn’t have confirmation or information of NSFAS that he is fully funded,” Damon said. READ: NSFAS pleads with students to apply for funding before deadline Another family is still waiting for the outcome of their application. “I have to run around, where do I get this funds for? I am not working, I am at home now. Other times I wouldn’t ask anything, I would pay the funds but now I need help and I need assistance for her to finish her fourth year,” said Oelfia Hamza-Lamara. The National Student Financial Aid Scheme says it received 550,000 applications for the 2020 academic year. NSFAS says more than 400,000 candidates received their results during the first week of January. NSFAS administrator Randall Carolissen says this is something they'll be looking at internally. Meanwhile, the Damon and Lamara families are urging the NSFAS to urgently upgrade its portal and employ more call centre agents.
