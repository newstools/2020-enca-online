CAPE TOWN - Former Wales centre Jamie Roberts has signed a one-year contract to play for South African Super Rugby side the Stormers. "It has long been a goal of mine to play in the Southern Hemisphere and I cannot think of a better place to do so than in the Western Cape, where people are so passionate about their rugby and also staying in Cape Town, which is such an amazing city," Roberts said in a statement from the Stormers.

"He is renowned around the world for his professionalism and we are all looking forward to the impact he will have here.” Roberts played the last of his 97 tests in 2017 and toured South Africa and Australia with the British and Irish Lions. The Stormers open their season at home to New Zealand’s Wellington Hurricanes on 1 February.
