Disabled drivers on KwaZulu-Natal's South Coast are taking the wheel when it comes to their own transport. PORT SHEPSTONE - Disabled drivers on KwaZulu-Natal's South Coast are taking the wheel when it comes to their own transport. A decade after a car accident left him paralysed, Viran Maniram got his first job. Over the next six frustrating years, he worked on getting his driver’s licence. With a lack of suitable driving schools around, he saved up for his own car, modified it, and took the test. Now, he wants to make it easier for others. WATCH: Disabled cyclist calls for inclusivity in SA He’s opened an NPO -- the first of its kind here -- called the Magazi Learners and Driving Academy for the Disabled. And it won’t cost students from poor backgrounds a cent. "This idea came out when I used to take taxis to travel to work. Sometimes the taxis they don’t want to stop," said Maniram. "It’s a mission for the conductor to put the wheelchair inside, it’s time-wasting, so they feel they’re losing other customers. "That’s how this whole thing came about -- to make disabled people independent and make it more comfortable for their lives so they don’t go through the same struggles that I have been through.” Now that the wheels are in motion, Maniram is appealing to funders to come forward to keep his dream of empowering the disabled alive.
