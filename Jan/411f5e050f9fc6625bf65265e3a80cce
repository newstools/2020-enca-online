CAPE TOWN - As thousands of motorists make their way back home, many aren't abiding by the rules of the road. Western Cape traffic officials say they've had a busy festive season as holidaymakers entered the province.

The Western Cape Transport department says it's prepared for another busy period.
Western Cape Transport MEC, Bonginkosi Madikizela said, "we know a lot of people are coming back from holidays and others and obviously the focus is on those main roads N1 and N2."
So far, motorists have been issued more than R8-million worth of fines since the beginning of the festive season. While this number is less than the previous year, authorities remain concerned about pedestrian deaths.
Madikizela says he expects traffic volumes to go up this weekend as more people return home.
Traffic authorities have urged motorists leaving the Western Cape to obey the rules of the road.
