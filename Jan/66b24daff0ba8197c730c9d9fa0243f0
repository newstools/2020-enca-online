The party's general-secretary Blade Nzimande made the announcement at the 25th commemoration of the death of its former leader, Joe Slovo. The ANC’s national and Gauteng leadership snubbed the event, despite two years ago promising it would never do so. The ANC said it couldn't attend because of the party's preparations for its birthday celebration in Kimberley this week. WATCH: SACP commemorates Joe Slovo “When we are supposed to adopt the January 8 statement and engage on it, everybody would like to ensure that they are present,” said ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule. Nzimande said more of his party’s members must join ANC branches to rescue the movement. “This is an opportunity for all communists, go back to your ANC branches and work in there,” he said. Both the SACP and Cosatu want changes to the alliance partnership with the ANC, amid discontent over the governing party’s appointments to Parliament and city councils.
