LAS VEGAS - Startup Bzigo showcased a gadget designed to spot mosquitoes and then mark them for death. Bzigo, pronounced like "buzz" and "go" combined, watches constantly for flying mosquitoes and then hits them with a beam of laser light after they land. The first generation of the device marks mosquitoes for termination, sending an alert to people's smartphones to prompt them to execute the insects. INFOGRAPHIC: Mosquitoes pose a threat to half the world "A big problem with mosquitoes is finding them, that is what we solved,"  said Nadav Benedek of Bzigo. The World Health Organization has branded mosquitoes among the planet's deadliest creatures due to their ability to carry diseases that kill millions of people annually. Even in locations where mosquito-borne diseases are not a problem, the buzzing blood-suckers are often abhorred.

"A nano-drone flies from a docking station on the device, goes to the mosquito, kills it, and it comes back to recharge," Benedek said, prompting a nearby visitor to the CES booth to laugh uncontrollably. Bzigo has already raised a million dollars in funding, and is out to raise $5-million to begin mass production of the device, which will be about the size of an apple when it reaches market, according to Benedek.
