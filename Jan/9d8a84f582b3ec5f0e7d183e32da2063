The 1980s document, ‘Close Comrades’, named people in Barbara Hogan's circle and was intercepted by security police. JOHANNESBURG - Former Minister Barbara Hogan regrets writing a report on her peers. The 1980s document, called ‘Close Comrades’, named people in her circle. Hogan has told the inquest into Neil Aggett's death it was meant to ensure their protection and intended for the ANC. But the report was intercepted by security police and was a factor in the arrest of Hogan, Aggett and others. “A lot of the suffering that people went through, a lot of that was attributable to this report," Hogan said.

Hogan says Aggett wasn't an ANC member, but he was arrested and held at John Vorster Square. Aggett died in detention on the 5th of February 1982. Hogan was also held in detention at the same police station, handcuffed to a chair and assaulted. She says, “Prince started hitting me on my back, on my, across my face, for quite a period of time. I started bleeding internally.” WATCH: ANC stalwart testifies on Aggett Her interrogators nearly broke her. “I just didn’t see my way clear of how I would see my way through this and I tried to commit suicide.” Hogan recalls the last time she saw Aggett. “He gave me a big smile and he did an 'Amandla' salute to me and I noticed his shirt was torn and that was the last time I saw him.” Reverend Frank Chikane is set to speak on Thursday.
