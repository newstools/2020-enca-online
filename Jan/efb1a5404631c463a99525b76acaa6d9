Tinder and its online dating siblings which make up the Match Group, will be spun off as an independent company in 2020. WASHINGTON - Tinder announced Thursday that US users would soon have a "panic button" to alert authorities to potentially dangerous situations as part of a stepped-up safety initiative by the popular dating app. A new feature unveiled by Tinder will allow users to opt into the personal safety app Noonlight, which connects users to personal emergency services. A Tinder spokesperson said the feature would roll out in the coming days in the United States and connect users to "trained dispatchers who contact authorities on behalf of the user." The new safety feature "acts as a silent bodyguard in situations when you're alone or meeting someone for the first time," said Brittany LeComte, co-founder of Noonlight. Tinder is also adding photo verification, to compare using artificial intelligence a posed photo taken in real-time to profile photos.
