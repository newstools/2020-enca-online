Spanish biker Laia Sanz is taking part in the rally for the 10th time. JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia - They may be few in number but the women who have come to Saudi Arabia to race their vehicles across the sands in this year's Dakar Rally are making their voices heard. Many of the 13 women, from Europe, South Africa and South America, who started the race in Jeddah on Sunday feel the need to speak out for their Saudi sisters. "I am sure it is positive to show everyone here that women can be competitive and strong and I am happy to represent women here," said 34-year-old Spanish biker Laia Sanz, who is taking part in the rally for the 10th time. The organisers sparked controversy by switching the race from South America to Saudi, which is regularly accused of human rights abuses and the suppression of dissenting voices, including feminist activists.

Dakar organisers and drivers "should speak out against the Saudi government's mistreatment of women's rights activists for advocating for the right to drive," said Minky Worden of Human Rights Watch in a statement.

"We are fortunate to be female athletes coming (to Saudi Arabia) to compete and able to demonstrate that there are women who do things in a man's world," the 51-year-old with the pink Side-by-Side Vehicle told AFP. In recent months, concerts and sports competitions in front of mixed audiences have multiplied in Riyadh and Jeddah. In October, Riyadh hosted Saudi Arabia's first female wrestling match when Natalya, a Canadian, took on Lacey Evans, an American. Both wore more discreet outfits than they would normally do in the WWE.
