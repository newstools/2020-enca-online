READ: SA a new safe haven for big cats “These cats were in terrible condition, they were in tiny tiny cages and you'd have something like six cats in a really small cage, no room to move, no room to exercise. They were malnourished, they were only being fed chicken feet and they were all poorly developed, the younger ones their bodies were badly developed through not getting the right food,” said Jan Creamer, President, and founder of Animal Defenders International. The animals now have access to an abundance of grassland and water at the ADI Wildlife Sanctuary in the Free State. Although they are now able to roam free inside an enclosure, they can't be returned to the wild. Some of the animals no longer have their claws and teeth.
