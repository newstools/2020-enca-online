File: Under the new slow play policy, data from the PGA Tour's Shotlink database will be analysed to identify players guilty of slow play. LOS ANGELES - PGA Tour players guilty of slow play will face tougher fines and more frequent stroke penalties under tough new rules due to take effect in April, tour officials said. A PGA Tour statement said maximum fines for slow play will be increased tenfold from their current level while players taking too long to play shots will be placed on an observation list. "You talk to players, read articles, hear from fans," PGA Tour chief of operations Tyler Dennis said. "What gets people, what gnaws at them, are these individual habits that people have. It's seen as bad etiquette, it's seen as a distraction, and we're targeting those individual moments to help their fellow competitors and assist our media partners with presentation." Under the new slow play policy, data from the PGA Tour's Shotlink database will be analysed to identify players guilty of slow play. Players will be placed on the tour's observation list and subjected to warnings if they exceed 60 seconds to play a shot. A second breach of the time limit in a tournament will result in a one-stroke penalty. The observation list however will not be made public. Players will be notified if they are on the list on a week-to-week basis. Any player in a tournament -- even if they are not on the observation list -- will also be penalised if they are found to take longer than 120 seconds to play a single shot without good reason. Players will face a one-shot penalty for the second time breach in a tournament -- rather than a round -- while the maximum fine for cumulative bad times over a season has been raised to $50,000 from the current level of $5,000. The new regulations will go into effect at the RBC Heritage in South Carolina in April.
