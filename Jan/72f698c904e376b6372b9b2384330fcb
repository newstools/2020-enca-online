Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Elizabeth Floyd has given a graphic account of the surveillance, and harassment she and Neil Aggett faced from apartheid police. She was testifying at the inquest into the death of the trade unionist and anti-apartheid activist. Floyd was Aggett's girlfriend in 1981 when he was detained. She's spoken of the trauma she endured during her last visit to him.

My conclusion was that somebody was being tortured and everyone on that floor could hear it,” Floyd said. After months apart, Floyd learnt the tragic news – that Aggett allegedly hung himself. She was denied permission to attend his funeral but was granted permission to view his body.

Floyd has insisted that they don’t believe Aggett committed suicide, and want the truth. The inquest continues on Friday where former detainees will testify.
