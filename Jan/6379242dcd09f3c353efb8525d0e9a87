File: Average temperature in 2019 was only a few hundredths of a degree below the 2016 level. PARIS - 2019 was the second hottest year on record and ended the hottest decade in history, the European Union's climate monitoring service said Wednesday. Data released by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) showed that worldwide temperatures last year were second only to 2016, in which temperatures were boosted by an exceptionally strong El Nino weather event. Average temperature in 2019 was only a few hundredths of a degree below the 2016 level. The five warmest years in record have all occurred in the last five years and the period of 2010-2019 was the hottest decade since records began, C3S said.
