The DA has been pushing for Busisiwe Mkhwebane to be removed for the past two years. Speaker, Thandi Modise, has approved a motion, according to new rules adopted by the house in December. READ: Parliament gets green light on removal of Public Protector "I'm very pleased at the speed in which the speaker has moved and the urgency the Parliament is dealing with this issue," said Natasha Mazzone, DA's Chief Whip. Last year, the National Assembly adopted new rules with regards to the removal of heads of chapter nine institutions. “If the Speaker is satisfied that the motion meets all requirements, the National Assembly Speaker must refer the motion and any supporting documents for preliminary assessment to an independent panel. The Speaker must also, without delay, inform the Assembly and the President of this referral,” Parliament said in a statement.
