One plan that incorporates all three has made waves on social media, encouraging thousands to evaluate their lifestyle choices. Sam Hlonyana said his "90 Days Without Sugar" concept began after he realised that healthy living required real change. “I didn’t expect us to reach here so soon. I think the growth has taken us by surprise, but I think it’s good that many more people are trying to live a healthy lifestyle”, said Hlonyana.

So for me – have a strong why, have a long-term exercise or competition that you want to, and have strong accountability”, added Hlonyana. Hlonyana also details the sustainability of the movement in his book Life After Dieting: A 90-Day Blueprint On How To Lose Weight, Defeat Sugar Addictions and Transform Your Health Forever.
