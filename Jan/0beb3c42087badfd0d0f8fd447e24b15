JOHANNESBURG - Controversial couple Mampintsha and Babes Wodumo have stopped the airing of their reality show. The Gqom musicians approached the court at the eleventh hour on Thursday. This forced Moja Love channel to stop the screening of the show about the couple's lives. The reality show called Impilo was supposed to be screened last night. After posting a video on social media of the artists involved in a dispute there was a backlash. Some people accused the show of promoting violence. Mampintsha took to Instagram to say he has considered concerns raised. The couple's relationship has been in the spotlight following allegations of abuse. A video of Mampintsha assaulting Babes went viral on social media last year. She laid an assault charge against him, but later withdrew it.
