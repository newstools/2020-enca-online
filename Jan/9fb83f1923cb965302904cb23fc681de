Jan took to television in 2017 with an award-winning travel and cooking series named after him. And now he's dishing up a second season. "I’s just a little bit more of South Africa, more travelling, more opulence," he said. "It’s not a cooking show, it’s not where people can see where I cook but how I see life and what inspires me to get to an end product.”
