A major operation to reach thousands of people stranded in fire-ravaged seaside towns was under way in Australia after deadly bushfires ripped through popular tourist spots and rural areas. SYDNEY - Australia authorised the forced evacuation of residents amid a mass exodus of tourists from fire-ravaged coastal communities, as the country braces for a weekend heatwave expected to fan deadly bushfires. Catastrophic blazes ripped through the country's south-east on New Year's Eve, killing at least eight people and stranding holidaymakers. New South Wales (NSW) Premier Gladys Berejiklian declared a seven-day state of emergency that allows for forced evacuations beginning Friday, for the third time in Australia's most populated region this fire season.

It came after the NSW Rural Fire Service declared a "tourist leave zone" stretching about 200 kilometres from the popular holiday spot of Bateman's Bay along the picturesque coast to neighbouring Victoria state, where people are also being urged to flee. At least 18 people are now known to have died in one of Australia's most devastating bushfire seasons yet, and there are growing fears the toll could rise dramatically, with officials in Victoria saying 17 people were missing in the state.

That weather will create conditions officials say will be as bad as -- if not worse than -- Tuesday, the deadliest day in a months-long bushfire crisis.
