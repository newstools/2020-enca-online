Provincial officials are worried and now want to work with ward councillors to help stop former inmates from reoffending. As of October last year, there were over 17,00 prisoners in the Western Cape. Many convicts find it difficult to adjust and fit into society when they are released on parole.

According to the Western Cape government, police are overlooking this. “If you engage with station level or station commander level, they are not always informed about parolees coming into areas,” said Western Cape premier Alan Winde.
