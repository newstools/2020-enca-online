File: Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane. SOWETO - Mamelodi Sundowns’ title hopes have been dealt a huge blow following their 1-0 loss to Orlando Pirates at Soweto Stadium on Wednesday. Gabadinho Mhango's sole goal on the night was enough, to fulfill the hopes of archrivals Amakhosi fans, who were praying for a Sundowns loss. The defeat leaves the Tshwane giants 9 points behind log leaders Kaizer Chiefs. But Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane in typical style, is still talking tough. READ: Mosimane plays it cool ahead of Pirates clash “Why should I worry about 9 points difference when people don’t worry about titles? Why should I worry about 9 points when people don’t worry about going to the world cup, people don’t worry about winning the champions league and I worry about 9 points? Maybe I should phone Pep because I have his number and say my friend you are in trouble 15 points what are you going to do? I mean it’s football you move on 9 points difference so what?” he said. It will not be easy for Sundowns to close the gap, as their next match is against SuperSport United, in this weekend’s Tshwane Derby.
