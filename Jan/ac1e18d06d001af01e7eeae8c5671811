Some will be packing their lunch tins for the very first time, while others will be in their final school year - a daunting, but exciting time indeed. Underpinning successful study time is food. So we have to pack smart for our kids. Food is critical for their brain development and happiness. No sugar and plenty of greens. Good nutrition is an important part of a child's development.
