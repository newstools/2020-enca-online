A year ago he was crowned King of the Mountains in Australia but Dlamini won't be returning to defend his title.
Dlamini's manager says because this is now a legal matter, Dlamini's been advised not to speak to the press. He's being represented by an international law firm that's lodged a case on his behalf.

However, it's confirmed that the rangers involved in this incident are still on suspension. It's expecting a report on the matter from a law firm this week.
