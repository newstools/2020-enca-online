DURBAN - The KZN Education Department has until Thursday to release its draft school transport policy for public comment. The department was ordered to release the policy by the court following an application by Equal Education. The document should have been released by 31 December. READ: Parents should check school transport, says minister KZN Education has also recently come under fire after a picture of pupils crossing a river to get to school went viral. Leanne Jansen-Thomas from Equal Education said there seems to be a lack of political will to address the problem. Jansen-Thomas said the transport issues violate the pupils right to learn as they have to traverse treacherous conditions in extreme weather and arrive at school tired and with a compromised capacity to learn.
