Katlego Otladisa of Ajax Cape Town takes on Ricardo Versuur of TS Sporting during the GladAfrica Championship 2019/20 game between Ajax Cape Town and TS Sporting at Cape Town Stadium on 15 January 2020. DURBAN - Ajax Cape Town remain on track for a return to the PSL. The Urban Warriors top the GladAfrica Championship after a 2-1 victory over Real Kings at Chatsworth Stadium. Head coach Andries Ulderink doesn't want his charges to get head of themselves just yet. "For me it's simple, it's still a very long way. If you are a little bit less in this league than straight away you lose two games and that how it works and if you lose another two games then you can forget to stay in top of the league. You have to perform at every week again look I only look to my players and for my players it would be a great to be promoted and I look to play in the PSL because all of them have the level to perform again."
