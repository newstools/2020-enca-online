Hogan was imprisoned at John Vorster square at the same time as Aggett. Then aged 28, doctor and trade unionist, Aggett was detained by the apartheid police security branch in 1981. He was found dead on February 5, 1982 after he allegedly hung himself with his scarf in his prison cell. WATCH: Aggett inquest continues However, a few hours before he died, Aggett had made an affidavit stating he had been assaulted and given electric shocks. An inquest into his death was held in December 1982 where the then magistrate Pieter Kotze ruled his death as a suicide. Through lobbying by the Aggett family, a new inquest was opened. The landmark probe is only the second inquest ever into the mysterious deaths of dozens of activists who died in police detention at the infamous John Vorster police headquarters in Johannesburg during apartheid.
