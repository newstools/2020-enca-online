FILE: "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker" continues to rule the cinematic universe, keeping its top ranking in North American theatres this weekend. LOS ANGELES - "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker" continues to rule the cinematic universe, keeping its top ranking in North American theatres this weekend with $34.5 million, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations said Monday. That brought the three-week domestic total for the Disney film -- marketed as a grand finale of the nine-film "Skywalker Saga" -- to $451.6 million. It has taken an additional $468 million overseas, as it inches closer to the $1 billion mark overall. Holding onto the second spot again was Sony's "Jumanji: The Next Level," an action sequel with Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Kevin Hart, which took in $26.2 million for the Friday-through-Sunday period. Overall, it was an impressive weekend for Sony, which had three films in the top five. Its "Little Women" moved up from fourth last weekend to third, with a take of $13.6 million.

Many were irate that it missed out on nods for best director or best film at the weekend's Golden Globes. Saoirse Ronan did get a best actress nomination for her role as Jo March, but lost to Renee Zellweger ("Judy").
