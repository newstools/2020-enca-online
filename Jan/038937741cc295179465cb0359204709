Gumede's implicated in a now 389 million rand Durban Solid Waste tender. Together with her fifteen co-accused, she appeared in court on Wednesday and case postponed to the 16th of April 2020.

Gumede says she's gone beyond her former mayoral position in eThekwini. Now, her fight is for political survival and the position of a powerful region of the ANC in eThekwini. WATCH: I am as poor as a church mouse, says Zandile Gumede "Cloud hanging over my head? a big yes. It is not a positive thing for me, it is very painful. For the position of being the Chairperson of the ANC in the region, yes if the branches say I must stand, no one can stop them." The ANC fired Gumede for a dismal performance in the province's economic hub. But, she claims she didn't collapse the only metro in the province and she says the State must just bring it on.
