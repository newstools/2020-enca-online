Mourners attend the funeral of the Iranian Major-General Qassem Soleimani, head of the elite Quds Force of the Revolutionary Guards, and the Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who were killed in an air strike at Baghdad airport, in Baghdad, Iraq, January 4, 2020. TEHRAN - Washington asked Tehran to respond "in proportion" after US forces killed top Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, the deputy commander of the Revolutionary Guards said. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps confirmed Soleimani, the commander of its Quds Force foreign operations arm, had been killed on Friday in a US airstrike near Baghdad airport.

They "even said that if you want to get revenge, get revenge in proportion to what we did", he said, quoted on the broadcaster's website. Fadavi did not say how Iran received the message from its enemy, even though Tehran and Washington have had no diplomatic relations for four decades. Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a separate television interview on Friday night that "Switzerland's envoy transmitted a foolish message from the Americans this morning".

Switzerland's embassy in Tehran has represented US interests in the Islamic republic since ties were cut in 1980. But Fadavi said the United States was not in a position "to determine" Iran's response. "The Americans must await severe revenge. This revenge will not be limited to Iran," he said. "The 'Resistance Front', with a vast geography, is ready to materialise this revenge," he added, referring to Iran's allies across the Middle East.
