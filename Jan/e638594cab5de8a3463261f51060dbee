A district official and the school principal have been suspended while investigations are underway. Mpianzi was only 13-years-old with dreams of becoming a lawyer. He went to a school camp two weeks ago and came back in a body bag.

"My brother will never hold a grudge against me although we would have small but very childish arguments," said Gift Mpianzi, Enock's brother. "He was my best friend as we shared many characteristics and made good memories together. "We are grateful that he is gone back to the Father. As from dust we came and to dust we shall return. Enock is no more.” READ: Enoch Mpianzi's mother: School failed my son The Gauteng education department is still probing Enock's death. “We can’t say we don’t have answers, we can’t say that we don’t know what happened I urge all teams investigating to make a report available ASAP,” said Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi. Mpianzi's family walked through a guard of honour, something the teenager would have done when he matriculated in 2024, to signal the end of his high school career. He will be laid to rest at the weekend
