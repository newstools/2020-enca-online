He says Vasco Da Gama and Katlego Mathebe violated their code of conduct, acted as constitutional delinquents - and have shown no remorse. Maile announced their suspension as DA councillors but the DA says it'll take Maile to court for political harassment. READ: MEC suspends two Gauteng speakers He said they acted in their own interests when presiding over council sittings where they faced motions of no confidence from the ANC. Maile said their actions disrespected the Constitution. “They are not remorseful, they believe they are correct. They don’t see anything wrong with disrespecting our constitution,” he said. Maile says the decision to suspend the pair as councillors wasn’t taken lightly. “The decision we are taking has got far-reaching implications for the rules of engagements in these municipalities going forward. You would have seen a lot of disruptions previously, we don’t want to see that anymore in Gauteng.” Maile denied playing politics but the DA believes the MEC’s political allegiance to the ANC motivated his actions. “It’s a total abuse of his position and it’s, of course, to remove the speaker of Tshwane to make way for them to have their nefarious motions of no confidence passed in the city,” said DA Gauteng leader, John Moodey.
