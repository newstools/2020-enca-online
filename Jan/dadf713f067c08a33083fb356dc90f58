They journeyed to the mountains as part of the cultural practice of initiation. With the aid of the Indlondlo traditional institute, the complications and malpractice often associated with initiation schools were avoided. The Zulu King, Goodwill Zwelithini, welcomed the new men home. "Our children, we want teachers from you, we want pastors, educators, we want doctors, we want nurses, we want soldiers, hear me carefully. We want soldiers." The KZN Traditional Affairs MEC  Sipho Hlomuka says the province is promoting the cultural practice. "We want to encourage others that they must follow suit because it's a culture of Kokstad that people must go to entabeni and learn how to be a man". The King says the employment of responsible cultural practices will ensure the empowerment of the nation.
