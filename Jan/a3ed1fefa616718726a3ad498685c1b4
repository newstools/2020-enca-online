The Boulders Beach penguins in Cape Town are in danger of leaving and never coming back. CAPE TOWN - The Boulders Beach penguins in Cape Town are in danger of leaving and never coming back. The colony there is a popular attraction for both locals and tourists. But the constant photographing up close and posing with them is scaring them away. This is especially concerning as conservationists say the African penguin population is lower than it’s ever been in South Africa. The SA Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds says in 2010 there were 22,000 breeding pairs. READ: Algoa Bay penguin population under threat Now there are just over 13,000. It says the Simon’s Town colony is still stable, but it’s crucial to protect the penguins to ensure the survival of the species. NPO Sea the Bigger Picture says Simon’s Town visitors are getting too close to the penguins in the area. SANCCOB says more education is needed, as well as better enforcement of rules around Boulders. SANParks has committed to installing interpretive signage in the next two months to highlight the sensitive nature of the area.
