Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Projects by two local young scientists will be showcased at the 2020 Taiwan International Science Fair. Farida Cajee (18) from Hoërskool Schweizer-Reneke in the North West and Miné Steenkamp (16) from Hoërskool Douglas in Kimberley, won the judges over at the Eskom Expo for Young Scientists International Science Fair with their incredible science projects. In September last year, Cajee designed a 'mind-controlled 3D-printed prosthetic hand'. READ: SA scientists braving the cold for research "My prosthetic is actually printed from recycled single-use plastic, such as cola bottles and plastic bags. By using the recycled single-use plastic, I can print the prosthetic at a very low cost and I use the plastic as ink for the prosthetic", said Cajee. Cajee said it took time to design the prosthetic hand but she was adamant about finding a solution that would help change the world.
