South African musician Yvonne Chaka Chaka says she has not been deported from Uganda. JOHANNESBURG - South African musician Yvonne Chaka Chaka says she has not been deported from Uganda.
This follows reports on social media she was stopped from performing at a New Year's Eve event and sent back to South Africa. Police in Uganda confirmed the deportation, saying there was a problem with her visa. Ugandan police spokesperson Fred Enanga said in a video posted on Twitter that they are hopeful Chaka Chaka will visit the country again "when she applies for the correct visa”. Chaka Chaka, however, has a different interpretation of events. She posted a video on Twitter from an unknown location. “As you can see, I am here, all is well," she told her fans. "I took the decision not to appear this evening at Enkuuka because there were just too many things I didn’t understand. "If somebody had explained it to me, I would have understood.” Chaka Chaka said she has not been deported, nor arrested. “Not deported, not arrested, not captured, everything is fine; everything is in order," she said. "I know my country is worried, my people are worried, my husband is worried. Everybody is worried. But I am fine.”
