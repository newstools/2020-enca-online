File: Peter Moyo was fired in June 2019. JOHANNESBURG - Old Mutual has won an appeal against Peter Moyo's temporary reinstatement as CEO. The company is now free to appoint a CEO of its choice.  Old Mutual axed Moyo twice in June and August, saying that it had become clear that a continued employment relationship was untenable. Old Mutual Chair, Trevor Manuel, said Moyo was fired because of a conflict of interest. Moyo sued Old Mutual and its directors for R250-million after the group refused to let him resume his duties, despite a court ruling that he should be reinstated.
