JOHANNESBURG - Cash-strapped SAA has cancelled dozens of local and international flights for February. The state-owned airline says this is in a bid to cut costs and save cash. WATCH: Mounting misfortune worsens at SAA The move to cut flights comes after SAA secured R3,5-billion in funding from the Development Bank of Southern Africa this month. Aviation expert Phuthego Mojapele said the airline is trying to be preemptive in cost-cutting and implementing money-saving measures. READ: What it means for SAA to be in 'business rescue' Mojapele said communicating earlier to prepare consumers for changes to their flights is an encouraging sign. "I think they have communicated with the travel agencies and those affected passengers to rebook them on Star Alliance partners and sharing airline partners as well this time around they have done it slightly better than last time," he said.
