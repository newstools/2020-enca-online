They want to reclaim their status as the country's cup kings. Chiefs chairman, Kaizer Motaung said the 50 years have been golden. “When we started, a lot of people thought this is one of those passing things that will fall by the wayside. There were critics and sceptics who did not believe we were serious. When I look back, I feel very proud and fulfilled,” said Motaung.
