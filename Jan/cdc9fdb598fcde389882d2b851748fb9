JOHANNESBURG - Traditionally a hotspot for trouble, Hillbrow in Johannesburg was uncharacteristically peaceful and quiet on New Year's Eve.

The Gauteng Provincial Police Commissioner Lt-Gen Elias Mawela laid out the plans for the evening, saying the police would be sending a strong message to criminals. Clubs and taverns in Hillbrow welcomed the police's top brass as the streets reflected the same jovial but peaceful atmosphere. Police might have expected violence in the notorious suburb but this year they were pleased with the outcome of what they say was a collaborative process.

They would throw the fridges and bottles out there. You can see now that when the community sees us they celebrate with us."
"All we want is peace and happiness for everyone."
Sadly, the quiet wouldn't last very long. Within a few hours almost 20 people had been shot in Johannesburg. Eight people in Melville and 11 in Newtown were caught up in gun-related violence, just hours into the new year.
