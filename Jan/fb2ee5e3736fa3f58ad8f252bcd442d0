Parliament will not extend the deadline for submissions on land expropriation without compensation. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The governing ANC party is making a stunning about-turn on the issue of land expropriation without compensation. The party is ditching a key clause in the proposed bill it previously supported in Parliament. The clause as it currently stands gives the judiciary power to decide on instances when no compensation should be paid. Now suddenly, the ANC no longer supports that proposal.

The Chairperson of Parliament's ad-hoc committee on the constitutional amendment, Mathole Motshekga said there will be public hearings on the matter. “We are saying that this is not an ANC process, other political parties must make their inputs. The people of South Africa...must make their inputs...,” Motshekga.
