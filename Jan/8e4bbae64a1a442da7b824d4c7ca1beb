Iranian mourners gather around a vehicle carrying the coffin of slain top general Qasem Soleimani during the final stage of funeral processions in his hometown Kerman. KERMAN - More than 50 people were crushed to death on Tuesday at the funeral of an Iranian general in the southeastern city of Kerman, Iranian media reported, citing a morgue count. The tragedy left 212 people injured, a small number of whom were in a serious condition, semi-official news agency ISNA added, citing Kerman's emergency services chief Mohammad Saberi. The crush came as Iran prepared to bury Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani, a hugely popular figure in the Islamic republic.

Soleimani, the head of the Guards' Quds Force foreign operations arm, was assassinated on Friday in a US strike near Baghdad international airport, an operation that shocked Iran. Tuesday's funeral comes after days of processions through the southwestern city of Ahvaz and the shrine cities of Qom and Mashhad as well as the capital Tehran.

In Tehran, President Hassan Rouhani on Monday warned US President Donald Trump to "never threaten" Iran, after the US leader issued a US strike list of 52 targets in the Islamic republic. On Tuesday, Iranian lawmakers voted to designate all US forces around the world "terrorists" over Soleimani's killing.
