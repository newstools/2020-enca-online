US actor Terry Crews arrives for the 72nd Annual Directors Guild of America Awards at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Los Angeles on January 25, 2020. JOHANNESBURG - American actor Terry Crews has responded to widespread criticism after he defended America's Got Talent against Gabrielle Union's allegations of a toxic work environment. Crews, who is a host on the show, appeared on the Today show last week and said Union's allegations of racism and sexism on the show were not his experience.

In fact, it was the most diverse place I have ever been in my 20 years of entertainment‚Äù, said Crews. Several people called out Crews for his comments, reminding him that Union publicly supported him after he came out with allegations that an industry executive had groped him in 2017. Following public outcry, Crews took to Twitter on Tuesday morning and basically told everyone that he did not owe anyone, except his wife, anything. The comment has not been received well and has led to more outrage on social media.
