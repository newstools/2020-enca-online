Gusts of up to 100 kilometres-per hour forced the closure of the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway on Friday, though no injuries have been reported so far. Storm-related electricity disruptions have also been experienced. WATCH: Wind warning for Capetonians The City of Cape Town's JP Smith says electricity teams are working hard to restore power as quickly as possible. "We have roofs that were damaged in Bo Kaap, Bonteheuwel, Bomakierie, Macassar, Philippi and Seapoint and then a lot of storm-related electricity disruptions with power lines being taken down by trees. The electricity team is working hard to restore power as quickly as possible." Weather authorities say strong winds aren't unusual during this time of the year. According to meteorologist Anika de Beer, "A strong southeasterly winds in Cape Town around summer is a common phenomenon, however, this weekend is particularly windy for Capetonians. A cut off low system developed on Friday evening south-west of the country and this system is fueling that south-easterly wind too strong and even gale-force winds."
