MAHIKENG - Monday has seen the suspension of classes at the North-West University's Mahikeng campus following a call by the SA Union of Students for a national shut down of universities. The union is unhappy with the Higher Education Department after talks to assist poor students broke down. READ: Student hunger at SA universities needs more attention Universities South Africa CEO Ahmed Bawa said some of the demands made by the students are valid, some have been met, and some are in the process of being met. Bawa said one of the main issues raised -- of historic debt -- cannot be met by individual universities and require a long-term, national solution. He said protests have become routine and there are other methods of resistance that may be more productive than shutting down institutions.
