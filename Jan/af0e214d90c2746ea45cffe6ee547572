The choir wowed international audiences when it was crowned runners-up in the America’s Got Talent competition last year. Mabuza-Suttle, who's now based in the United States, supported the choir during their time in the competition. She says she couldn't leave South Africa without seeing the youth. “These are my children, When I heard they are in Johannesburg I had to come see you I even changed my flight just for you,” Mabuza-Suttle said.
