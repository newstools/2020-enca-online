The multi-purpose studio video wall – the biggest on the African continent - will ensure that the eNCA viewer receives voice, pictures, text, and videos at an enhanced sensory level. JOHANNESBURG -  eNCA is pleased to announce the launch of a high-tech HD studio that will go live on Monday, 13 January at 06:00 AM CAT, on DStv channel 403 across SADC countries. The innovative studio boasts a massive 12 x 3 meter curved LED video wall. The multi-purpose studio video wall – the biggest on the African continent - will ensure that the eNCA viewer receives voice, pictures, text, and videos at an enhanced sensory level. Live in-studio action will be captured by six HD cameras, five of which are on robotics and the sixth on a jib. Group Technical GM Rose Rogers said, "Our use of this technologically advanced equipment in the new HD studio is exceptional and will provide a sharp and refreshing feel to all our programs. The semi-circular set shape will allow for an increase in camera angles compared to the previous U-shaped set design. It took us months of work to ensure that the new studios are a perfect fit for the upgraded broadcast quality." Joe Heshu, Group Executive for Corporate Affairs at the MultiChoice Group said: “In line with our purpose of giving and delighting our viewers with great quality content and entertainment, eNCA’s launch of the high-tech HD studio on our platform is just one more way of ensuring we can play a role in supporting the growth of the local TV industry and creating lasting partnerships with local stakeholders which will guide the success of the industry.”
