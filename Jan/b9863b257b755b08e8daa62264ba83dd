READ: Numsa wants Eskom board dissolved Trade Union, Numsa has received retrenchment notices from mining companies, Samancor Chrome and Glencore. Both companies cited high electricity costs, power supply problems, as well as financial difficulties among other reasons. As many as 595 workers could be affected at Samancor Chrome. Glencore said it plans to retrench 665 workers. Numsa warns the numbers could be more. The Union said it's wary of Samancor's poverty plea, saying the company is involved in a R500-million deal to purchase Hemic Ferrochrome but those are not the only jobs at risk in the first month of 2020. Telkom announced earlier this month that it would cut 3,000 jobs, while retail giant Massmart plans to close 34 of its stores, a move which will see over 1,400 people out of work. Meanwhile, Sibanye-Stillwater said it has given more than a thousand of its workers, voluntary packages. Samancor and Glencore have applied to the CCMA to facilitate their retrenchment processes.
