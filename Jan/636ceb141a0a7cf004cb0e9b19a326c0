READ: Eskom keeps lights on Energy expert Lungile Mashele says this is a battle of titanic proportions. "Itâ€™s an unprecedented move by Eskom, publicly fighting Nersa. For Nersa the biggest thing is around its reputation as an independent regulator. Eskom says we need to remain solvent. Nersa is saying but you're not maintaining your plant and there's still mismanagement within the entity itself." Watch the full interview above for more on this story.
