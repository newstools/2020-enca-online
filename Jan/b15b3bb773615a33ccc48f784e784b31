Police said at least four men with their faces covered took part in the assault. Judge Benedicto Abicair said he was ordering the film yanked for now so as to calm tempers until courts can consider the broader merits of a suit against the movie brought by a Catholic association called the Don Bosco Center for Faith and Culture. Abicair's ruling can be appealed. Netflix and the production company said they had not yet received the judge's order. Porta dos Fundos is an award-winning comedy producer founded in 2012. It garnered an international Emmy in 2018.
