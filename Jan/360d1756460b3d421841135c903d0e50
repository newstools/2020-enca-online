Bowler Dane Paterson will travel to Port Elizabeth for the third Test, which starts on Thursday. JOHANNESBURG - The South African selectors have added fast bowler Dane Paterson to an unchanged team for the third Test against England, starting in Port Elizabeth next Thursday. Cricket South Africa announced an unchanged larger squad – but only Paterson of those who did not play in the XI beaten by 189 runs in the second Test in Cape Town will travel to Port Elizabeth. The non-playing members of the squad – Temba Bavuma, Beuran Hendricks, Keegan Petersen, Andile Phehlukwayo and Rudi Second – will play for their franchises in a round of four-day matches starting on Monday. Independent selector Linda Zondi said the released players remained "part and parcel" of the selectors’ thinking but it was believed it was better for them to be playing first-class cricket rather than training with the Test players. The four-match World Test Championship series is tied at 1-1.
