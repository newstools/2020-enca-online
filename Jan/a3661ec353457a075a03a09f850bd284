This has led to violent clashes between supporters and police. Chamisa says the country is a ticking time bomb. He believes dialogue is needed to avoid a bloody civil war. "People have to dialogue without spilling blood, it is a better solution than to lose lives so that we are able to go to dialogue," Chamisa said.
