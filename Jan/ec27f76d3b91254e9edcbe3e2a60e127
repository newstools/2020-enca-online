JOHANNESBURG - Leaders of two powerful NGOs are optimistic some of those deeply involved in state capture will soon reveal themselves. WATCH: Magashule's former assistant testifies at state capture inquiry Corruption Watch's David Lewis and CASAC's Lawson Naidoo were speaking on the Fix on Sunday.
Lewis theorised, "as soon as others start to see that the risk is too high, you may start to see people volunteer the information sought in plea-bargaining types of deals. This is an optimistic view, but I think the momentum is going to speed up considerably once the canaries start singing."
