Players spend their days training for the battle royale game Free Fire and recording videos for Loud's channel as well as their own, which are also hugely popular on YouTube. RIO DE JANEIRO - Brazil's video game channel Loud has been ranked as the most popular new YouTube channel in 2019 after it attracted 3.4 million subscribers in 10 months. Players spend their days training for the battle royale game Free Fire and recording videos for Loud's channel as well as their own, which are also hugely popular on YouTube. Psychologists and performance coaches are regular visitors to the Loud house, where several players live, along with specialists in audiovisual production or social media. While the players appear to spend much of their time goofing around, the money generated by mobile games is no joke. Mobile games were expected to pull in more than $68-billion in revenue worldwide last year, Newszoo research group said in a mid-year report -- 45 percent of the total video game market. Loud's gamers, aged in their twenties, travel around the world taking part in Free Fire competitions where individual prize money reaches tens of thousands of dollars. Free Fire, which has more than 450 million registered users, is a game where players fight for survival in a shrinking battlefield. Fans can watch the Loud team playing Free Fire or performing pranks on each other in their spacious residence on their YouTube channels. Two of the channels  were ranked in YouTube's top 10 most popular new channels last year.
