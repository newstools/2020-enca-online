READ: Enoch Mpianzi timeline questioned as another pupil drowns The 13-year old died on the first day of school at Bekker Primary in Magaliesburg. Police and education department authorities are investigating the circumstances surrounding the teen's death. Gauteng education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi visited the family on Sunday.
Lucia Seboko, Keamohetswe's mother shared her last memories of her son, "the last time I saw him, I hugged him, I gave a kiss and I said see you on Friday, the ironic thing is I saw him on Friday, but he was not alive"
Lucia says she does not believe that her child's death was without foul play... The grade 7 pupil drowned in the school pool on Wednesday. The teen's mother believes he was being bullied. She said she saw cuts on the boy's lip and head.
Seboko's 9-year-old cousin discovered the teen's floating underwear while she was swimming. The young girl is still traumatised and doesn't want to go back to school.
The school says it has a zero-tolerance to bullying and would wait for the autopsy results before commenting on allegations of foul play.
The education department says if the report points to anyone, or if it's found the child was indeed bullied... and I quote 'heads will roll'. Two of the family's children, who are at the school, will be removed as per the family's request.".
