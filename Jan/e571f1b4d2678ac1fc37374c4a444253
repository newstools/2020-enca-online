Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Cash-strapped South African Airways will be selling nine aircraft. The airline says this is to accommodate four new Airbuses it recently acquired and that it has nothing to do with its business rescue process. This while that process is struggling to get off the ground. READ: SAA placed under business rescue Last month, the Public Enterprises Minister said Treasury would provide half of the R4-billion needed to avert liquidation. But those funds have not materialised, leading to reports that the airline's wings will be clipped. Treasury and the Public Enterprises Department are not commenting, referring queries to the business rescue practitioners, Les Matuson and Siviwe Dongwana. They say government continues to show support for the process. WATCH: How far can SAA fly? The rescue practitioners also hope to keep SAA airborne saying liquidation is not a consideration at this stage. Unions Numsa and Solidarity are raising their concerns about government's failure to honour its financial commitment. Solidarity's Connie Mulder says government withholding funding is surprising. WATCH: SAA can't be saved, says Free Market Foundation "Government put SAA under business rescue voluntarily last year and now it is for some weird reason withholding funding for the process to unfold." Matuson is expected to report back to unions on Friday hopefully to provide some clarity on whether salaries will be paid this month.
