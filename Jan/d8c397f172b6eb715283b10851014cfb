Eskom's inability to keep the lights on dealt a major set back to the mining industry. Henk Langenhoven, Chief Economist from the Minerals Council South Africa weighs in on how mining companies want to solve the problem.

Henk Langenhoven, from the MRC said, "the companies went one by one to the Energy Minister but now there's a group effort as a result of the unreliability." Langenhoven explained how allowing the companies to provide energy for themselves would ease the load on the national grid. "The mining sector, because it's such a big user...you can locate it in a specific area, it's the easiest way and quickest to get rid of a big amount of power."
