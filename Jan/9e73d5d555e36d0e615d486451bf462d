Inspections at Aggett's cells are set for Tuesday and the family wants the media present. The court will make a ruling once the South African Police Service gives reasons for wanting to bar filming. WATCH: High Court probes death of anti-apartheid Niel Aggett Proceedings came to a rather abrupt end on Monday after Warrant Officer Kgamanyane disclosed that police don't want television cameras present when the court inspects Aggett's detention cells. Aggett died suspiciously in detention in 1982. A state inquiry found he had killed himself, and therefore no one else could be held responsible. READ: AfriForum to request formal inquest into Senzo Meyiwa's death After steadfastly petitioning the justice minister, Aggett's family got the state to re-open the inquest. According to the Aggett family lawyer, Howard Varney, "we are here today to search for the truth of what happened to Neil. The truth that was suppressed in the first inquest and which was denied to his family, comrades friends and the nation for some 38 years. It will be our submission that massive and obvious fraud was perpetrated by the state in the 1982 inquest that demands the overturning of the original finding." Inside the court, the investigator in the case revealed he took over the case a mere seven months ago. And since then had discovered that crucial records were missing or had been destroyed, many witnesses were deceased, and cooperation from state departments and agencies wasn't quite what he'd hoped for.
