Connor McGregor claimed his last victory -- his 21st in 25 bouts -- in 2016. LOS ANGELES - Mixed martial arts star Conor McGregor returns to the Octagon after a 15-month absence seeking -- he says -- to leave controversy behind him. The Irish star takes on experienced Donald "Cowboy" Cerrone on Saturday at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas -- where Wednesday's final press conference offered a remarkable display of respect from a fighter as famed for his trash talk as his formidable left hook.

However, Cerrone appears to be on the wane, considering his last two losses last year to Tony Ferguson and Justin Gaethje.

I have the advantage of speed, I'm well prepared, there's no one to touch me." McGregor claimed his last victory -- his 21st in 25 bouts -- in 2016. Since then, McGregor has been battered into submission by arch-rival Khabib Nurmagomedov in a contest that was marred by a massive brawl at ringside and been knocked out by boxing great Floyd Mayweather in a cross-combat superfight in Vegas in 2017.
