Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - An Imam is on the run after allegedly defrauding Cape Town Muslims -- including pensioners -- who were hoping to visit Mecca. They were meant to leave on Christmas Day, but the man who was supposed to book their tickets let them down. According to some Muslim clergy, this is not the first time this has happened. Fasiegh Adams has since been spotted in Durban. One of his victims is Narima Abrahams, who saved for seven years.

She says she cried for days. “Why does one Muslim do this to another Muslim and he calls himself an Imam?” she tearfully asked. Adams is not answering his phone and people are being asked to be on the lookout for him. The Council of Muslim Theologians has warned those defrauding people who want to go on Hajj and Umrah, that action will be taken against them.
