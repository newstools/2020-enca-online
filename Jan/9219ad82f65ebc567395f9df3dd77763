UMZIMKULU - Teachers and pupils of Mthwane Secondary School were faced with a grisly discovery upon the opening of school. A newly-erected tombstone was found in a classroom. The school was built on contested land. One family, split into two opposing factions, claims ownership of the land, while other members of the community claim the land is communal. READ: Global and historical lessons on land reforms The people who built the tomb refused to speak with eNCA but one man from the same family said his late grandfather is the rightful owner of the land. The Education Department has said the claims from the family “borders on extortion”. KZN Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu said the family wants nothing besides compensation. Mshengu said the department will head to court to have the tombstone removed. In the meantime, pupils have been moved to another classroom, creating a problem of overcrowding.
