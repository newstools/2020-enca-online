The Western Cape usually produces some of the country's top students. While the stakes are high for many of them, for others it's been a trying year. Chante Stoffels is on tenterhooks. She’s hoping for a bachelor’s pass. But at Westridge High in Mitchells Plain, there are often distractions from the books. READ: The long wait for matric results "There are gangsters in the environment. There are shootings, stabbings, robbing," said Chante. Across town, a pupil from Westerford -- one of Cape Town’s best schools -- is hoping for top marks to study medicine. “There’s not as much pressure as you would feel just thinking about being in that kind of situation," said Luke Figaji. At Islamia College, Hussain Moosa hopes he’s done enough to be accepted for physiotherapy. "I’m hoping for the best, so just good marks.” Whatever the outcome, these pupils say they gave it their best.
