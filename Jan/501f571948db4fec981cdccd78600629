"What we've done as the university is seat down , look at minimum criteria to assist students so that they can register.  Unfortunately there is a portion that students must pay. For example, at our lowest category,  15% of historical debt must be paid and that's where we start to have these issues," Ashton Bodrick, UKZN spokesperson, said. Students are demanding that those who are owe the university money still be allowed to register. "We are fighting that struggle and the elephant in the room in the UKZN is that we have a situation whereby the university is declaring that students must pay registration fee... and 15%. Now if i'm owing R78 000 it means I must pay registration and 15% of what I'm paying which students find it hard," SRC president, Sifiso Simelane said. Howard College Campus remains closed and management says it hopes that registration will resume on Thursday. Meanwhile, students have vowed to continue with their protest until their demands are met.
