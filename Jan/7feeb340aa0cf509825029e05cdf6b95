eNCA's Jane Dutton had an illuminating conversation with an activist who is spearheading the call for representation for people living with albinism. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - South African lawyer, activist, and model Thando Hopa said her journey towards ensuring representation for people living with albinism has not been easy. "I would not call it an easy task at all. When I started this, back in 2012, in terms of representation, especially in mainstream media, there was no representation when it came to albinism. "The issues related to albinism were quiet multi-faceted and so I went into this journey, not really having a mentor. There was nobody who was walking this journey that I had seen in my past," said Hopa. READ: Thando Hopa graces Vogue cover Hopa made history in 2019 when she graced the cover of Vogue Portugal. "The interesting thing about being good looking is that I sort of had to negotiate that concept into media because for centuries a woman like me was not considered as part of the good-looking factor when you look at beauty and representation. "But I do think that how I chose to dress myself is through my mind and that is what I chose as my dominant appearance," added Hopa.
