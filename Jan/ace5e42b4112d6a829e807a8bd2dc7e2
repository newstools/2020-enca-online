Sofia Kenin of the US hits a return against Australia's Ashleigh Barty during their women's singles semi-final match. MELBOURNE - Feisty American 14th seed Sofia Kenin stunned world number one and home hope Ashleigh Barty to reach her first Grand Slam final at the Australian Open on Thursday. Kenin will play either Romania's fourth seed Simona Halep or unseeded Garbine Muguruza in Saturday's final after her surprise 7-6 (8/6), 7-5 victory. Moscow-born Kenin, who looked shocked in the immediate aftermath, said: "She's such a tough player, she's playing really amazing. I knew I had to really find a way to win. "I'm just speechless, I honestly can't believe this. I've dreamed about this moment since I was five years old." "I've worked so hard to get here," added Kenin. "I really had to fight out here. There's a reason she's number one." Kenin, the last American left in a sweltering Melbourne, where play on the outside courts was suspended as temperatures hit 38 Celsius, was the party pooper once more. She had already brought the fairytale run of 15-year-old Coco Gauff to an end in the fourth round with the aggressive style of play that has become her trademark over the past fortnight. And she was at it again as temperatures soared at a fiercely pro-Barty Rod Laver Arena. Both players retreated into the shade on court whenever they could. Kenin, who had a breakthrough 2019, winning her first three WTA titles, was contesting her first Grand Slam semi-final, and it was Barty's first time in the last four in Melbourne.
