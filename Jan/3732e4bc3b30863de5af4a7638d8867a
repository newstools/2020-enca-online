File: The power utility is implementing stage 2 load-shedding from 9PM until 6 on Friday morning. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom is warning that load-shedding may continue well into the weekend. The power utility is implementing stage 2 load-shedding from 9PM until 6 on Friday morning. It says this is due to system constraints and depleting emergency resources. READ: Eskom to implement stage 2 load-shedding Eskom says it's been forced to use diesel generators, as power systems are under pressure. This has resulted in a delay in returning its units to service. While it has enough emergency reserves to keep the lights on during the day, Eskom says load-shedding will be needed overnight. It's also urging consumers to use electricity sparingly.
