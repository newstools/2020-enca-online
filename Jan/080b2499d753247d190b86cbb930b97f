Courtesy #DStv403 HARARE - The World Food Program (WFP) says the economic meltdown in Zimbabwe is affecting feeding programs to millions of hungry people. Zimbabwe is in the midst of a severe drought and over four million people are facing starvation. Due to the deterioration of an economy that brimmed with hope less than two years ago, many people in both urban and rural areas can no longer afford to put food on the table. The crippling drought has worsened the situation. READ: UN to deliver food aid to Zimbabwe, fears 'major crisis' “The economic situation makes it difficult for us to operate at cost-effective level. Almost every aspect of our operation, the cost has increased threefold, so it has a direct impact on the number of people we would reach. For example, transport costs we just did an analysis, the cost of contracting a contractor to move food from point A to B of about 100km has increased by 28 percent,” said WFP Zimbabwe director, Eddie Rowe. The WFP Zimbabwe boss is also overwhelmed by the huge number of Zimbabweans who need food assistance.
