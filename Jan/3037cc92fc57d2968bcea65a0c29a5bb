Butterfly expert Reiner Terblanche said most of them come from the Northern Karoo.

Terblanche said there are many threats, such as birds and dragonflies, that could kill the butterflies on their way to the destination. "You'll find that some birds eat the butterflies, some chameleons can do that and some spiders as well," added Terblanche.
