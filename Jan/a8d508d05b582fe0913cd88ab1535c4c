Todd Phillips's "Joker," a bleak, arthouse take on the comic book villain starring Joaquin Phoenix, was just ahead of three films. LOS ANGELES - Dark comic book tale "Joker" topped the Oscar nominations on Monday, picking up 11 nods including best picture and best director, as women and ethnic minorities were largely shut out once again. Todd Phillips's "Joker," a bleak, arthouse take on the comic book villain starring Joaquin Phoenix, was just ahead of three films. Quentin Tarantino's 1960s Tinseltown homage "Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Sam Mendes's World War I odyssey "1917" and Martin Scorsese's "The Irishman" each earned 10 nominations, including best picture as well as best director. South Korean class satire "Parasite," from Bong Joon-ho, secured the final best director slot, meaning once again no female directors made the shortlist. Much of the focus so far this award season has been on the lack of women and ethnic minority filmmakers honoured.

Controversy over those omissions, in an industry criticised for its lack of diversity, was fueled at last week's BAFTA nominations, which were also condemned for overlooking ethnic minorities. Notable snubs included Eddie Murphy for blaxploitation biopic "Dolemite Is My Name," Jennifer Lopez for "Hustlers," Awkwafina for "The Farewell" and Lupita Nyong'o for "Us." Renee Zellweger, who has swept the best actress nominations so far during this awards season, headed the best actress Oscar shortlist thanks to her acclaimed turn as showbiz legend Judy Garland in "Judy." Some 9,000 Academy members vote for the Oscars. The Oscars will be handed out in Hollywood on 9 February.
