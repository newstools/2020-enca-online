File: The MAX was grounded globally after the Ethiopian Airlines crash in March. WASHINGTON - The number of people killed in large commercial airplane crashes fell by more than 50 percent in 2019, despite a high-profile Boeing 737 MAX crash in Ethiopia in March. Aviation consulting firm To70 said there were 86 accidents involving large commercial planes -- including eight fatal incidents -- resulting in 257 fatalities last year. In 2018, there were 160 accidents, including 13 fatal ones, resulting in 534 deaths, the firm said. To70 said the fatal accident rate for large airplanes in commercial passenger air transport was just 0.18 fatal accident per million flights in 2019, or an average one fatal accident every 5.58 million flights, a significant improvement over 2018.

The 157 people killed in March on Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accounted for more than half of all deaths last year worldwide in passenger airline crashes. Over the last two decades, aviation deaths around the world have been falling dramatically even as travel has increased. As recently as 2005, there were 1,015 deaths aboard commercial passenger flights worldwide, the Aviation Safety Network said. In 2017, aviation had its safest year on record worldwide with only two fatal accidents involving regional turboprops that resulted in 13 deaths and no fatal crashes of passenger jets.
