Gauteng Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC, Lebogang Maile, has given an ultimatum to the Tshwane council - shape up or be placed under administration. Maile says service delivery has collapsed under the DA coalition, while corruption in the city has increased. Reporter Govan Whittles, is tracking that story. Courtesy #DStv403 PRETORIA - End the water crisis in Hammanskraal, start collecting waste on time, establish ward committees and submit information on the City’s top 20 contracts. These are just some of the directives Gauteng’s local government MEC Lebogang Maile wants implemented before the end of February. The City of Tshwane risks being placed under administration as early as March this as Maile has issued directives the municipality must implement by the end of February but are his expectations reasonable or part of a political move to force the DA coalition out of power? The capital city has been plagued by poor service delivery since the last year and its mayor will once again face a motion of no confidence on Thursday. “They’ve got no choice. Anybody who will try to resist this intervention will actually be a constitutional delinquent and we are not going to take kind to that,” Maile said.

What we want is not to fight with anybody but to ensure that service delivery reaches our people.” The DA is accusing Maile of trying to use his position to place the City under administration – and collapse the coalition council. However, Maile says that’s not true. “If this was a political instrument we would have long used it because there has been a lot of wrong things taking place in the municipality for a very long time. But we have been meeting with the municipal leadership, we have been interacting with them, we have been writing them a lot of letters, until we came to this point,” Maile said.
