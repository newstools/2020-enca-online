LONDON - South Africa's World Cup-winning captain Siya Kolisi was voted the 2019 Rugby Union Writers' Club personality of the year on Monday.

The 28-year-old flanker led South Africa to World Cup glory last year, when England were crushed in the final in Japan.

It’s an honor & a privilege to receive this recognition from the Rugby Union Writer’s Club for the 2020 Pat Marshall award. To everyone that has been supporting me, my teammates, our sport, and our country, we will use this moment to continue bringing positive change to South Africa. Thank you. 🙏🏿🏆🇿🇦 A post shared by  Siya Kolisi (@siya_kolisi_the_bear) on Jan 13, 2020 at 10:22pm PST
